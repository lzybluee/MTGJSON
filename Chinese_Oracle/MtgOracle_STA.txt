<Multiverseid>517551</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: A card that changes zones is considered a new object, so casting the same Approach of the Second Sun card on a later turn is "another spell" named Approach of the Second Sun.
2017/04/18: If you have fewer than six cards in your library, you'll put Approach of the Second Sun on the bottom of your library. Otherwise, you'll lift up the top six cards without looking at them and place Approach of the Second Sun just under them.
2017/04/18: The second Approach of the Second Sun that you cast must be cast from your hand, but first may have been cast from anywhere.
2017/04/18: A copy of a spell isn't cast, so it won't count as the first nor as the second Approach of the Second Sun.
2017/04/18: As your second Approach of the Second Sun resolves, it checks only whether the first one was cast, not whether the first one resolved. If your first Approach of the Second Sun was countered, you'll still win the game as your second one resolves.
2017/07/14: Approach of the Second Sun has no effect until it's resolving. If the second one you cast is countered, you won't win the game.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: Once the exiled creature returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was.

Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2019/06/14: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2019/06/14: Casting the card again due to rebound's delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can't (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won't get another chance to cast it on a future turn. If you do cast the card, it's put into its owner's graveyard as normal once it resolves.
2019/06/14: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand is countered or doesn't resolve (most likely because its targets have become illegal), none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.</Rulings>

2013/09/15: You perform the actions stated on a card in sequence. For some spells and abilities, that means you'll scry last. For others, that means you'll scry and then perform other actions.

<Artist>Minttu Hynninen</Artist>
<Multiverseid>517561</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: ---------- The following rulings focus on the "protection from" keyword ----------
2017/08/25: If a player has protection from everything, it means three things: 1) All damage that would be dealt to that player is prevented. 2) Auras can't be attached to that player. 3) That player can't be the target of spells or abilities.
2017/08/25: Nothing other than the specified events are prevented or illegal. An effect that doesn't target you could still cause you to discard cards, for example. Creatures can still attack you while you have protection from everything, although combat damage that they would deal to you will be prevented.
2017/08/25: Gaining protection from everything causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets you. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
2017/08/25: ---------- The following rulings focus on what it means if your life total can't change ----------
2017/08/25: Spells and abilities that would normally cause you to gain or lose life still resolve while your life total can't change, but the life-gain or life-loss part simply has no effect.
2017/08/25: Protection from everything will usually prevent damage if it would be dealt to you, but some damage can't be prevented. In this case, because your life total also can't change, that damage has any other effects that it may have aside from causing you to lose that much life (such as effects from lifelink or infect) and triggers and effects can see that damage was dealt even though your life total didn't change.
2017/08/25: You can't pay a cost that includes the payment of any amount of life other than 0 life.
2017/08/25: If a cost includes causing you to gain life (like the alternative cost of an opponent's Invigorate does), that cost can't be paid.
2017/08/25: Effects that would replace having you gain life with some other event won't be able to be applied because it's impossible for you to gain life. The same is true for effects that would replace having you lose life with some other event.
2017/08/25: Effects that replace an event with having you gain life (like Words of Worship's effect does) or having you lose life will apply and end up replacing the event with nothing.
2017/08/25: If an effect would set your life total to a certain number that's different than your current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything.
2017/08/25: If an effect would cause you to exchange life totals with another player, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total changes.
2017/08/25: ---------- The following rulings focus on the phasing keyword ----------
2017/08/25: While a permanent is phased out, it's treated as though it doesn't exist. It can't be the target of spells or abilities, its static abilities have no effect on the game, its triggered abilities can't trigger, it can't attack or block, and so on.
2017/08/25: Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
2017/08/25: Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Banishing Light, won't happen when a permanent phases out.
2017/08/25: Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration such as that of Mathas, Fiend Seeker ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.
2017/08/25: Each Aura and Equipment that phases out attached to a permanent that's phasing out phases in with that permanent and still attached to it.
2017/08/25: Each Aura and Equipment you control attached to a permanent that isn't phasing out phases in attached to that permanent if it can still be attached to that permanent. If not, it phases in unattached. An Aura that phases in unattached will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. The same is true with Auras attached to players.
2017/08/25: Permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.
2017/08/25: Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
2017/08/25: If a token is phased out, it will phase in as your next untap step begins. This is a change from previous rules.
2017/08/25: A permanent phasing out causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets that permanent. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
2017/08/25: If your untap step is somehow skipped as your next turn begins, your phased-out permanents won't phase in until the next untap step you actually have, but you'll no longer have protection from everything and your life total can change again.
2017/08/25: Any creatures that phase in under your control as your next untap step begins will be able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn.
2017/08/25: If you gain control of another player's permanent and it phases out, if the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases in, that permanent phases in under that other player's control as your next untap step begins. If you leave the game before your next untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after your turn would have begun.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/06/01: A card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in that mana cost, regardless of how that cost may have been paid.
2011/06/01: Phyrexian mana is not a new color. Players can't add Phyrexian mana to their mana pools.
2011/06/01: To calculate the mana value of a card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, count each Phyrexian mana symbol as 1.
2011/06/01: As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with one or more Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, you choose how to pay for each Phyrexian mana symbol at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for X.
2011/06/01: If you're at 1 life or less, you can't pay 2 life.
2021/03/19: If a permanent has +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters on it, they're removed in pairs as a state-based action so that the permanent has only one of those kinds of counters on it.
2021/03/19: To proliferate, you can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
2021/03/19: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2021/03/19: Players can respond to a spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.</Rulings>

The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.

<Rulings>2011/01/22: Increasing Vengeance can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
2011/01/22: When Increasing Vengeance resolves, it creates one or two copies of a spell. You control each of the copies. Those copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copies will then resolve like normal spells, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2011/01/22: Each of the copies will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal). If there are two copies, you may change the targets of each of them to different legal targets.
2011/01/22: If the spell Increasing Vengeance copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones.
2011/01/22: If the spell Increasing Vengeance copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2011/01/22: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copies too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling and then copy it with Increasing Vengeance, the copies of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2021/03/19: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.
2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/03/19: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.</Rulings>
