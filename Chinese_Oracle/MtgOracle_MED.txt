<Artist>Zack Stella</Artist>
<Multiverseid>456589</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: Emblems behave similarly to enchantments: They have an ability that, in a general sense, continually affects the game. The primary difference between them is that emblems aren't permanents and don't exist on the battlefield. Nothing in the game can remove an emblem, simply because no other spell or ability references them. Once you get an emblem, you keep it for the rest of the game. Emblems have no color, name, card type, or other characteristics beyond the listed ability.
2013/07/01: Lethal damage and effects that say "destroy" won't cause a permanent with indestructible to be put into the graveyard. However, a permanent with indestructible can be put into the graveyard for a number of reasons. The most likely reasons are if it's sacrificed, if it's a creature whose toughness is 0 or less, or if it's an Aura that's either unattached or attached to something illegal.</Rulings>

Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.

<Rulings>2009/10/01: The player who is being controlled is still the active player.
2009/10/01: While controlling another player, you also continue to make your own choices and decisions.
2009/10/01: While controlling another player, you make all choices and decisions that player is allowed to make or is told to make during that turn. For example: -- You choose which lands the other player plays. -- You choose which spells the other player casts, and make all decisions as those spells are cast and as they resolve. For example, you choose the value of X for that player's Earthquake, the target for that player's Lightning Bolt, what mana that player spends to cast Day of Judgment, and what card that player gets with Diabolic Tutor. -- You choose which activated abilities the other player activates, and make all decisions as those abilities are activated and as they resolve. For example, you can have your opponent sacrifice their creatures to their Vampire Aristocrat or have your opponent's Caller of Gales give one of your creatures flying. -- You make all decisions for the other player's triggered abilities, including what they target and any decisions made when they resolve. -- You choose which creatures controlled by the other player attack, who or what they attack, and how they assign their combat damage. -- You make any choices and decisions that player would make for any other reason. For example, you could cast Fact or Fiction, choose that player to divide the revealed cards into piles, and thus divide those cards into piles yourself.
2009/10/01: You can't make the affected player concede. That player may choose to concede at any time, even while you're controlling their turn.
2009/10/01: You can't make any illegal decisions or illegal choices — you can't do anything that player couldn't do. You can't make choices or decisions for that player that aren't called for by the game rules or by any cards, permanents, spells, abilities, and so on. If an effect causes another player to make decisions that the affected player would normally make (such as Master Warcraft does), that effect takes precedence. (In other words, if the affected player wouldn't make a decision, you wouldn't make that decision on their behalf.) You also can't make any choices or decisions for the player that would be called for by the tournament rules (such as whether to take an intentional draw or whether to call a judge).
2009/10/01: If the targeted permanent or player is an illegal target by the time Sorin's first ability resolves, the entire ability doesn't resolve. You won't gain life.
2009/10/01: You only control the player. You don't control any of the other player's permanents, spells, or abilities.
2009/10/01: If the player affected by Sorin's third ability skips their next turn, the ability will wait. You'll control the next turn the affected player actually takes.
2009/10/01: Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.
2009/10/01: You could gain control of yourself using Sorin's third ability, but unless you do so to overwrite someone else's player-controlling effect, this doesn't do anything.
2009/10/01: You can use only the affected player's resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player; you can't use your own. Similarly, you can use the affected player's resources only to pay that player's costs; you can't spend them on your costs.
2009/10/01: For a player's life total to become 10, what actually happens is that the player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if the targeted opponent's life total is 4 when this ability resolves, it will cause that player to gain 6 life; alternately, if the targeted player's life total is 17 when this ability resolves, it will cause that player to lose 7 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2009/10/01: Sorin's third ability allows you to control another player. This effect applies to the next turn that the affected player actually takes.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Sorin's second ability causes the targeted opponent's team's life total to become 10. Only the targeted player is actually considered to have actually gained or lost life.
2016/07/13: While controlling another player, you can see all cards in the game that player can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, and any cards in that player's library the player may look at.
2016/07/13: Controlling a player doesn't allow you to look at that player's sideboard. If an effect instructs that player to choose a card from outside the game, you can't have that player choose any card.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: The third ability causes artifacts you control to become creatures in addition to their other card types.
2009/10/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature is subject to the "summoning sickness" rule: It can only attack, and its {T} abilities can only be activated, if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn.
2009/10/01: The effect from the ability overwrites other effects that set power and/or toughness if and only if those effects existed before the ability resolved. It will not overwrite effects that modify power or toughness (whether from a static ability, counters, or a resolved spell or ability), nor will it overwrite effects that set power and toughness which come into existence after the ability resolves.

<Name>Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God</Name>
<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Bolas (Loyalty: 4)</Type>
<ManaCost>{U}{B}{B}{B}{R}</ManaCost>
<CardText>Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God has all loyalty abilities of all other planeswalkers on the battlefield.
[+1]: You draw a card. Each opponent exiles a card from their hand or a permanent they control.
[-3]: Destroy target creature or planeswalker.
[-8]: Each opponent who doesn't control a legendary creature or planeswalker loses the game.</CardText>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: Nicol Bolas doesn't remove loyalty abilities from the other planeswalkers.
2019/05/03: Nicol Bolas doesn't gain any static or triggered abilities of other planeswalkers or any activated abilities they may have that aren't loyalty abilities.
2019/05/03: While Nicol Bolas may end up with an astonishing number of loyalty abilities, you can still activate only one loyalty ability of Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God each turn.
2019/05/03: If a loyalty ability of a planeswalker references the card it's printed on by name, treat Nicol Bolas's instance of that ability as though it referenced Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God by name instead. For instance, if Nahiri, Storm of Stone is on the battlefield, Nicol Bolas deals the damage if you activate the ability he gained from her.
2019/05/03: If an ability of a planeswalker exiles cards and another loyalty ability of that planeswalker references the exiled cards, those abilities are linked. If Nicol Bolas gains both abilities, the instances he has are similarly linked. Cards exiled by any other abilities Nicol Bolas has (such as his own first loyalty ability) won't be seen by those linked abilities.
2019/05/03: If any abilities trigger as you draw a card while resolving Nicol Bolas's first loyalty ability, those abilities don't resolve until after your opponents have exiled a card or permanent.
2019/05/03: After you draw a card as Nicol Bolas's first loyalty ability resolves, the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's somehow an opponent's turn, that opponent) chooses a permanent they control or chooses a card in hand without revealing that card. Then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Finally, all of the chosen cards are exiled simultaneously.
2019/05/03: In a Two-Headed Giant game, if one player on a team loses the game, the entire team loses the game, even if the other player controls a legendary creature or planeswalker.</Rulings>

<Name>Domri, Chaos Bringer</Name>
<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Domri (Loyalty: 5)</Type>
<ManaCost>{2}{R}{G}</ManaCost>
<CardText>[+1]: Add {R} or {G}. If that mana is spent on a creature spell, it gains riot. (It enters the battlefield with your choice of a +1/+1 counter or haste.)
[-3]: Look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal up to two creature cards from among them and put them into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.
[-8]: You get an emblem with "At the beginning of each end step, create a 4/4 red and green Beast creature token with trample."</CardText>
<Artist>Jason Rainville</Artist>
<Multiverseid>460128</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/01/25: Because it's a loyalty ability, Domri's first ability isn't a mana ability. It can be activated only any time you could cast a sorcery. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
2019/01/25: Riot is a replacement effect. Players can't respond to your choice of +1/+1 counter or haste, and they can't take actions while the creature is on the battlefield without one or the other.
2019/01/25: If a creature entering the battlefield has riot but can't have a +1/+1 counter put onto it, it gains haste.
2019/01/25: If you choose for the creature to gain haste, it gains haste indefinitely. It won't lose it as the turn ends or as another player gains control of it.
2019/01/25: If a creature enters the battlefield with two instances of riot, you may choose to have it get two +1/+1 counters, one +1/+1 counter and haste, or two instances of haste. Multiple instances of haste on the same creature are redundant, but we're not going to tell the Gruul how to live their lives.</Rulings>

<CardText>[+2]: You may discard a card. If you do, draw a card.

2016/04/08: If you find a noncreature artifact with Nahiri's third ability, it will still gain haste, even though it won't be meaningful unless that artifact becomes a creature.
2016/04/08: If the artifact or creature put onto the battlefield with Nahiri's third ability leaves the battlefield before the next end step, it won't be returned to your hand from its new zone.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>{2}{U}{B}</ManaCost>
<CardText>[+1]: Look at the top five cards of your library. You may reveal an artifact card from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.
[-1]: Target artifact becomes an artifact creature with base power and toughness 5/5.
[-4]: Target player loses X life and you gain X life, where X is twice the number of artifacts you control.</CardText>

<Multiverseid>456595</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/06/01: The artifact targeted by the second ability will retain any types, subtypes, or supertypes it has. Notably, if an Equipment becomes an artifact creature, it can't be attached to another creature. If it was attached to a creature, it becomes unattached.
2011/06/01: If the target of the second ability is already an artifact creature, its power and toughness will each become 5. This overwrites all previous effects that set the creature's power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after this ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
2011/06/01: Effects that modify that creature's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as -1/-1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2011/06/01: The number of artifacts you control is counted when the last ability resolves, not when it is activated.</Rulings>
