<Rulings>2016/11/08: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker or put onto the battlefield attacking during this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.
2016/11/08: If you cast Entrapment Maneuver after combat damage has been dealt, only creatures that survived combat can be sacrificed.
2016/11/08: Entrapment Maneuver doesn't target the creature to be sacrificed. The target player chooses one as it resolves. No player may take any other actions between the target player choosing the creature and you creating Soldier tokens.
2016/11/08: To determine how many Soldier tokens are created, use the toughness of the sacrificed creature as it last existed on the battlefield.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: Orzhov Advokist's ability doesn't target the creatures that receive +1/+1 counters. Their controllers choose them as the ability resolves. Players can't take actions between making their choices and the +1/+1 counters being placed.
2020/11/10: If a player chooses to accept Orzhov Advokist's gift, that player can't attack you or a planeswalker you control with any creatures during their next turn, even creatures that weren't on the battlefield as Orzhov Advokist's ability resolved.

It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2016/11/08: The token is an artifact in addition to its other types. This is a copiable value of the token that other effects may copy.
2016/11/08: If the copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2016/11/08: If the copied permanent is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that permanent copied.
2016/11/08: If the permanent copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.

2016/11/08: If one player loses the game before controlling the other player, the other player takes their turn normally.

2016/11/08: The player being controlled is still the active player during their turn.
2016/11/08: While controlling another player, the controlling player also continues to make their own choices and decisions.
2016/11/08: While controlling another player, the controlling player can see all cards in the game that the player being controlled can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, and any cards in that player's library that they may look at.
2016/11/08: While controlling another player, the controlling player makes all choices and decisions that the player being controlled is allowed to make or is told to make during that turn. This includes choices about what spells to cast or what abilities to activate, as well as any decisions called for by a triggered ability or anything else.
2016/11/08: The controlling player can't make any illegal decisions or illegal choices—that player can't do anything that the player being controlled couldn't do. The controlling player can't make choices or decisions for that player that aren't called for by the game rules or by any cards, permanents, spells, abilities, and so on. If an effect causes another player to make decisions that the player being controlled would normally make (as Master Warcraft does), that effect takes precedence. In other words, if the player being controlled wouldn't make a decision, the controlling player can't make that decision on their behalf.
2016/11/08: The controlling player also can't make any choices or decisions for the player being controlled that would be called for by the tournament rules (such as whether to take an intentional draw or whether to call a judge).
2016/11/08: The controlling player can use only the resources of the player being controlled (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player; the controlling player can't use their own resources to pay costs for the player being controlled. Similarly, the controlling player can't spend the resources of the player being controlled on any of the controlling player's own costs.
2016/11/08: If a player who would be controlled skips their next turn, the other player will control the next turn the affected player actually takes.
2016/11/08: Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.
2016/11/08: Controlling a player doesn't allow the controlling player to look at the controlled player's sideboard. If an effect instructs that player to choose a card from outside the game, the controlling player can't have that player choose a card.</Rulings>

Any "at the beginning of your upkeep" abilities it has won't trigger during your upkeep (unless you already controlled the permanent). Similarly, if you have an "at the beginning of your upkeep" ability that targets a permanent you control, that ability can't target it.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: Cards put into your hand without using the word "draw" don't count as cards drawn for Kydele's ability.
2020/11/10: If you haven't drawn any cards this turn, you can activate Kydele's mana ability, but it won't produce any mana.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.
2020/11/10: Only one card may be drawn no matter how much life was lost or how many players lost life.
2020/11/10: If a player lost life and subsequently lost the game, the player whose turn it is may draw a card.
2020/11/10: Ludevic's triggered ability triggers at the beginning of each player's end step, including yours, even if no player has lost life that turn. Whether or not a player has lost life is checked only as the triggered ability resolves.
2020/11/10: Ludevic's triggered ability will allow the player to draw a card if any player other than Ludevic's controller, including the player whose turn it is, lost life this turn.
2020/11/10: Ludevic's ability looks at the entire turn to determine whether the player may draw a card or not. It doesn't matter whether Ludevic was on the battlefield when the opponent lost life.
2020/11/10: Ludevic's ability checks only if another player lost life during the turn, not whether that player's life total decreased over the course of the turn. For example, if a player other than Ludevic's controller lost 2 life and then gained 8 life this turn, the player whose turn it is may draw a card.

<Multiverseid>420665</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: You must pay exactly X life or none. You can't pay less life to draw fewer cards.
2020/11/10: If a player was dealt combat damage and subsequently lost the game, Tymna's triggered ability counts that player to determine the value of X.
2020/11/10: If an effect creates an additional combat phase in a turn, it may also create an additional main phase after that combat phase. Tymna's ability triggers at the beginning of each of these postcombat main phases.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.
2020/11/10: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2020/11/10: You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you've cast each from the command zone clear for "commander tax" purposes.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/17: Vial Smasher the Fierce is banned as a commander in Duel Commander format, but it may be part of your deck.
2020/11/10: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2020/11/10: Vial Smasher's triggered ability triggers when you cast your first spell each turn, regardless of whose turn it is.
2020/11/10: Vial Smasher has to be on the battlefield at the moment you cast your first spell. If that spell causes Vial Smasher to leave the battlefield as an additional cost to cast it, Vial Smasher's ability can't trigger. If that spell is Vial Smasher itself, Vial Smasher's ability can't trigger.
2020/11/10: For spells with {X} in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine the spell's converted mana cost.
2020/11/10: Vial Smasher's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. If Vial Smasher's ability resolves and the spell that caused it to trigger has been countered, use that spell's converted mana cost as it last existed on the stack to determine how much damage is dealt.
2020/11/10: The opponent to be dealt damage is chosen at random while the triggered ability is resolving. After that opponent is chosen, you choose whether damage will be dealt to that player or to a planeswalker they control, and if so, which planeswalker. No player may take any actions between the damage recipient being chosen and the damage being dealt.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities.

Whenever Yidris, Maelstrom Wielder deals combat damage to a player, as you cast spells from your hand this turn, they gain cascade.

<Rulings>2016/11/08: Spells you cast from your hand this turn will gain cascade even if Yidris leaves the battlefield.
2016/11/08: If Yidris's triggered ability resolves more than once in one turn, spells you cast from your hand will gain cascade that many times. Each instance of cascade triggers separately; resolve one cascade trigger and the spell you cast from it before resolving the next cascade trigger.
2016/11/08: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2016/11/08: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2016/11/08: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
2016/11/08: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2016/11/08: You don't have to cast the last card exiled by a cascade ability. If you choose to do so, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. Since it's cast from exile, Ydris's ability won't give the new spell cascade.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/11/08: The triggered ability triggers both when Armory Automaton enters the battlefield and whenever it attacks. You don't have to choose only one.
2016/11/08: You can choose to target no Equipment if you don't want to attach any to Armory Automaton. Because the ability is optional, you also don't have to attach the Equipment it targets as you resolve the ability. However, you must either attach all of the target Equipment or attach none of them.
2016/11/08: Armory Automaton's ability can cause an Equipment one player controls to become attached to a creature another player controls. The controller of the Equipment can pay the equip cost to move that Equipment to a creature they control, but only any time that player could cast a sorcery. The controller of Armory Automaton can't pay the equip cost to move Equipment they don't control.
2016/11/08: If an Equipment an opponent controls is attached to a creature you control, any ability of that Equipment that says "you" refers to that opponent. However, if the Equipment says that the equipped creature has an ability, the word "you" in that ability refers to you, the controller of the creature.
2016/11/08: If Armory Automaton leaves the battlefield before its ability resolves, nothing happens to any of the Equipment it targeted. If they were already attached to other creatures, they remain attached to those creatures.
2016/11/08: An ability of an Equipment that triggers "whenever equipped creature attacks" triggers only if the Equipment was attached to a creature at the moment that creature was declared as an attacker, and any references to "that creature" in the effect refer to the creature the Equipment was attached to when the ability triggered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/11/08: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. Colorless is not a color.
2016/11/08: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2016/11/08: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes Crystalline Crawler cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} to cast it and have it enter the battlefield with five +1/+1 counters.
2016/11/08: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/11/08: The colors of mana that Prismatic Geoscope can produce aren't related to the specific basic land types among lands you control. For example, if you control a Plains and an Island, you can activate Prismatic Geoscope's ability to add {R}{G} to your mana pool.
2016/11/08: You can activate Prismatic Geoscope's mana ability if you have no basic land types among lands you control, but it won't produce any mana.
2016/11/08: Prismatic Geoscope can't produce colorless mana.
2016/11/08: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look for the Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest subtypes among the lands you control. Count each subtype that appears one or more times toward the number of basic land types among lands you control. This number can't exceed five.
2016/11/08: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests are the same as one Forest.
2016/11/08: Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Caves of Koilos is neither a Plains nor a Swamp.
2016/11/08: Some nonbasic lands do have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control—they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, a Blood Crypt, and a Forest, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
2014/07/18: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, are unaffected.
2014/07/18: Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a creature to copy with Mercurial Pretender, are also unaffected.
2014/07/18: Hushwing Gryff's ability stops a creature's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that would trigger when a creature enters the battlefield.
2014/07/18: The trigger event doesn't have to specify "creatures" entering the battlefield. For example, Amulet of Vigor says "Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, untap it." If a creature enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor's ability would not trigger. If a land (that isn't also a creature) enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor's ability would trigger.
2014/07/18: Look at the permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger. For example, if you control March of the Machines, which says, in part, "Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature," each artifact will be a creature at the time it enters the battlefield and will not cause triggered abilities to trigger.
2014/07/18: If Hushwing Gryff and another creature enter the battlefield at the same time, neither creature entering the battlefield will cause triggered abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jim Murray</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420691</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2018/12/07: Reveillark's ability may target zero, one, or two creature cards in your graveyard. Each target must have power 2 or less.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Aeon Chronicler may become lethal if cards leave your hand during that turn.
2021/03/19: The ability that defines Aeon Chronicler's power and toughness applies in all zones, not just the battlefield.
2021/06/18: If this is suspended, then when the last time counter is removed from it, both its triggered ability and the "cast this spell" part of the suspend ability will trigger. They can be put on the stack in either order.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.</Rulings>

For example, if there are two +1/+1 counters on Chasm Skulker and it gets three -1/-1 counters, you'll get two Squid tokens.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: Multiple instances of convoke on a single spell are redundant.
2021/03/19: You can tap any untapped creature you control to convoke a spell, even one you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn.
2021/03/19: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated. Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or mana value.
2021/03/19: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: It's important to reveal a card with miracle before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand.
2018/07/13: You can reveal and cast a card with miracle on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2018/07/13: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2018/07/13: You don't have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don't wish to cast it at that time.
2018/07/13: You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won't be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
2018/07/13: You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing rules based on the card's type.
2018/07/13: Miracle is an alternative cost to cast the spell with miracle. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a miracle cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to cast it using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The only difference between a colored artifact and a colorless artifact is, obviously, its color. Unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact requires colored mana to cast. Also unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact has a color in all zones. It will interact with cards that care about color. Other than that, a colored artifact behaves just like any other artifact. It will interact as normal with any card that cares about artifacts, such as Shatter or Arcbound Ravager.
2008/10/01: This effect doesn't change the mana cost or mana value of an artifact spell. Rather, it reduces the total cost of the spell, which is the amount you actually pay while casting it. The total cost takes into account additional or alternative costs.
2008/10/01: This effect can reduce only the generic portion of the artifact spell's total cost.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/03/19: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.
2021/03/19: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: All blocking declarations must still be legal.
2014/11/24: If there's a cost associated with having a creature block and you choose for that creature to block, its controller can choose to pay that cost or not. If that player decides to not pay that cost, you must propose a new set of blocking creatures.
2014/11/24: You'll choose how each creature controlled by an opponent blocks, even if that creature wasn't on the battlefield or wasn't controlled by an opponent as the activated ability resolved.
2014/11/24: In a multiplayer game, if more than one player activates Brutal Hordechief's activated ability on the same turn, the controller of the last ability to resolve will choose how any creatures controlled by players who didn't resolve this ability will block.
2014/11/24: The defending player affected by Brutal Hordechief's triggered ability is determined relative to the creature that attacked. For example, if Brutal Hordechief attacked one opponent and two other creatures you control attacked another opponent, the first opponent would lose 1 life and the second opponent would lose 2 life. You'd gain a total of 3 life.</Rulings>

<CardText>Exile all creature cards from target player's graveyard in a face-down pile, shuffle that pile, then manifest those cards. (To manifest a card, put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)</CardText>
<Artist>YW Tang</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420728</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The pile is shuffled to disguise from your opponents which manifested creature is which. After you manifest the cards, you can look at them.
2014/11/24: If you manifest a card owned by an opponent and you leave the game, that card is exiled.
2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

2014/11/07: The ability of Daretti's emblem will return the artifact card only if it's still in your graveyard when the delayed triggered ability resolves at the beginning of the next end step. If the artifact card left your graveyard before that point (even if it was put back into your graveyard), the ability won't return it to the battlefield.</Rulings>

2010/03/01: If you're the defending player, Kazuul's ability triggers once for each creature that attacks, not just once per combat. The attacking player chooses whether to pay {3} or let you have an Ogre token each time one of those abilities resolves.
2010/03/01: As the ability resolves, you can't put the Ogre token onto the battlefield without explicitly giving the attacking player the option to pay {3}, even if the attacking player has forgotten about this ability.
2010/03/01: The ability triggers and resolves during the declare attackers step. If you put an Ogre token onto the battlefield as a result, you may block with it during that combat phase.
2010/03/01: If an attacking creature has a "Whenever this creature attacks" ability, that ability is put on the stack first, then Kazuul's ability is put on the stack. Although Kazuul's ability will resolve first, and potentially create an Ogre token, any target of the other ability will already have been chosen at this point, and thus could not have been the new Ogre token.
2010/03/01: In a multiplayer game, the ability checks whether you're the defending player for each individual attacking creature. For example, if one creature attacks you and two creatures attack another player, Kazuul's ability triggers just once.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: Past in Flames affects only cards in your graveyard at the time it resolves. Instant and sorcery cards put into your graveyard later in the turn won't gain flashback.
2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/03/19: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.
2021/03/19: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.
2021/03/19: If you cast an instant or sorcery with {X} in its mana cost this way, you still choose the value of X as part of casting the spell and pay that cost.
2021/03/19: If you cast a spell with flashback, you can't pay any alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the spell with flashback.
2021/03/19: If a card has multiple instances of flashback, you may choose any of its flashback costs to pay.
2021/03/19: If a split card gains flashback, you pay only the cost of the half you're casting.
2021/03/19: If a card with no mana cost gains flashback, it has no flashback cost. It can't be cast this way.</Rulings>

Each player discards their hand, then draws seven cards.</CardText>
<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420755</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2021/06/18: If a card with no mana cost is given an alternative cost equal to its mana cost (by Snapcaster Mage, for example), that cost cannot be paid and the card cannot be cast this way.
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A card with no mana cost can't be cast normally; you'll need a way to cast it for an alternative cost or without paying its mana cost, such as by suspending it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420785</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: Solidarity of Heroes can target any creatures, not just ones with +1/+1 counters on them. Notably, heroic abilities of any target creatures that put +1/+1 counters on that creature will resolve before Solidarity of Heroes.
2014/04/26: You choose how many targets each spell with a strive ability has and what those targets are as you cast it. It's legal to cast such a spell with no targets, although this is rarely a good idea. You can't choose the same target more than once for a single strive spell.
2014/04/26: The mana cost and converted mana cost of strive spells don't change no matter how many targets they have. Strive abilities affect only what you pay.
2014/04/26: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If one or more of its targets are legal when it tries to resolve, the spell will resolve and affect only those legal targets. It will have no effect on any illegal targets.
2014/04/26: If such a spell is copied, and the effect that copies the spell allows a player to choose new targets for the copy, the number of targets can't be changed. The player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, the player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2014/04/26: If a spell or ability allows you to cast a strive spell without paying its mana cost, you must pay the additional costs for any targets beyond the first.</Rulings>

Whenever a +1/+1 counter is put on Fathom Mage, you may draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420815</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/01/24: If multiple +1/+1 counters are placed on Fathom Mage simultaneously, its last ability will trigger once for each of those counters.
2013/01/24: If Fathom Mage enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it (perhaps due to Master Biomancer), its last ability will trigger once for each +1/+1 counter it entered the battlefield with.
2013/01/24: Fathom Mage's last ability will trigger whenever any +1/+1 counter is placed on it, not just ones due to the evolve ability.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.
2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

This is also true for any effects that were affecting the God when it was originally a creature. (Note that in most cases, the damage marked on the God won't matter because it has indestructible.)

For example, if the only nonland permanents you control are Pharika, God of Affliction and Golgari Guildmage (whose mana cost is {B/G}{B/G}), your devotion to black and green is four.

<CardText>You may have Progenitor Mimic enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it has "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn't a token, create a token that's a copy of this creature."</CardText>
<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420833</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Progenitor Mimic copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2013/04/15: The original Progenitor Mimic will create tokens, but those token copies will not.
2013/04/15: If you choose to have Progenitor Mimic enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature, the triggered ability it gains will become part of its copiable values. For example, suppose Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear, a 2/2 green Bear creature with mana cost {1}{G}. The resulting object is a 2/2 green Bear creature named Runeclaw Bear with mana cost {1}{G} and with "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn't a token, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of this creature." If another Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of that creature, it will be a Runeclaw Bear with two instances of the triggered ability.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature is a token, Progenitor Mimic copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Copying a token doesn't make Progenitor Mimic become a token.
2013/04/15: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2013/04/15: If Progenitor Mimic somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2013/04/15: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

<Artist>Clint Cearley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420846</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/01/24: You'll draw cards before deciding which creature (if any) Whispering Madness will be encoded on.
2013/01/24: Each player draws cards simultaneously. If this causes a player to draw more cards than are left in their library, that player will lose the game. If this causes all players to do so, the game is a draw. (In multiplayer games, multiple players drawing from an empty library will cause those players to lose although the game may continue.)
2013/04/15: If a creature with an encoded card deals combat damage to more than one player simultaneously (perhaps because some of the combat damage was redirected), the triggered ability will trigger once for each player it deals combat damage to. Each ability will create a copy of the exiled card and allow you to cast it.
2013/04/15: The exiled card with cipher grants a triggered ability to the creature it's encoded on. If that creature loses that ability and subsequently deals combat damage to a player, the triggered ability won't trigger. However, the exiled card will continue to be encoded on that creature.
2013/04/15: If another player gains control of the creature, that player will control the triggered ability. That player will create a copy of the encoded card and may cast it.
2013/04/15: The spell with cipher is encoded on the creature as part of that spell's resolution, just after the spell's other effects. That card goes directly from the stack to exile. It never goes to the graveyard.
2013/04/15: You choose the creature as the spell resolves. The cipher ability doesn't target that creature, although the spell with cipher may target that creature (or a different creature) because of its other abilities.
2013/04/15: If the spell with cipher doesn't resolve, none of its effects will happen, including cipher. The card will go to its owner's graveyard and won't be encoded on a creature.
2013/04/15: If the creature leaves the battlefield, the exiled card will no longer be encoded on any creature. It will stay exiled.
2013/04/15: If you want to encode the card with cipher onto a noncreature permanent such as a Keyrune that can turn into a creature, that permanent has to be a creature before the spell with cipher starts resolving. You can choose only a creature to encode the card onto.
2013/04/15: The copy of the card with cipher is created in and cast from exile.
2013/04/15: You cast the copy of the card with cipher during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type.
2013/04/15: If you choose not to cast the copy, or you can't cast it (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy will cease to exist the next time state-based actions are performed. You won't get a chance to cast the copy at a later time.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: Spells and abilities that would normally cause a player to gain life still resolve, but the life-gain part simply has no effect.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes life gain (like Invigorate's alternative cost does), that cost can't be paid.
2008/05/01: Effects that would replace gaining life with some other effect won't be able to do anything because it's impossible for players to gain life.
2008/05/01: Effects that replace an event with gaining life (like Words of Worship's effect does) will end up replacing the event with nothing.
2008/05/01: If an effect says to set your life total to a certain number, and that number is higher than your current life total, that effect will normally cause you to gain life equal to the difference. With Everlasting Torment on the battlefield, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than your current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
2008/05/01: The "damage can't be prevented" statement overrides all forms of preventing damage, including protection abilities. Damage prevention spells and abilities can still be cast and played; they just don't do anything.
2008/05/01: Spells and abilities that replace or redirect damage aren't affected by Everlasting Torment's second ability. They'll work as normal.
2008/05/01: The last ability affects all damage, whether it's dealt by creatures, other permanents, spells, or cards that aren't on the battlefield. Wither works everywhere.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: Each other creature copies the printed values of the targeted creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to that creature. They won't copy other effects that have changed the targeted creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on. They also won't copy counters on the targeted creature (they'll each just retain the counters they already have).
2008/05/01: If the targeted creature is itself copying a creature, each other creature will become whatever it's copying, as modified by that copy effect. For example, if you target a Cemetery Puca that's copying a Grizzly Bears (a 2/2 creature with no abilities), each other creature will become a Grizzly Bears with the Cemetery Puca ability.
2008/05/01: This effect can cause each other creature to stop being a creature. For example, if you target an animated Mutavault (a land with an activated ability that turns it into a creature), only the printed wording will be copied — the "becomes a creature" effect won't. Each other creature will become an unanimated Mutavault.
2008/05/01: Noncopy effects that have already applied to the other creatures will continue to apply to them. For example, if Giant Growth had given one of them +3/+3 earlier in the turn, then Mirrorweave made it a copy of Grizzly Bears, it will be a 5/5 Grizzly Bears.
2008/05/01: If the targeted creature is a token, each other creature copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Those creatures don't become tokens.
2008/05/01: As the turn ends, the other creatures revert to what they were before. If two Mirrorweaves are cast on the same turn, they'll both wear off at the same time.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/08/01: Casting a card by using its retrace ability works just like casting any other spell, with two exceptions: You're casting it from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you must discard a land card in addition to any other costs.
2008/08/01: A retrace card cast from your graveyard follows the normal timing rules for its card type.
2008/08/01: When a retrace card you cast from your graveyard resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered, it's put back into your graveyard. You may use the retrace ability to cast it again.
2008/08/01: If the active player casts a spell that has retrace, that player may cast that card again after it resolves, before another player can remove the card from the graveyard. The active player has priority after the spell resolves, so they can immediately cast a new spell. Since casting a card with retrace from the graveyard moves that card onto the stack, no one else would have the chance to affect it while it's still in the graveyard.
2008/08/01: As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying — or, if that creature is itself a token, the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield — as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on.</Rulings>

2011/06/01: Although creature tokens go to the graveyard before ceasing to exist, they never count as creature cards and won't increase the bonus granted by Bonehoard, however briefly.
2011/06/01: If lethal damage is dealt simultaneously to the equipped creature and another creature, both creatures are put into the graveyard at the same time. The equipped creature won't get an additional bonus from the other creature.
2020/08/07: If the living weapon trigger causes two Germs to be created (due to an effect such as that of Doubling Season), the Equipment becomes attached to one of them. The other will be put into your graveyard and subsequently cease to exist, unless another effect raises its toughness above 0.
2020/08/07: The Germ token enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature and the Equipment becomes attached to it before state-based actions would cause the token to die. Abilities that trigger as the token enters the battlefield see that a 0/0 creature entered the battlefield.
2020/08/07: Like other Equipment, each Equipment with living weapon has an equip cost. You can pay this cost to attach an Equipment to another creature you control.

<Rulings>2008/05/01: If a nontoken creature that gains persist this way is put into a graveyard, that card will be returned to the battlefield with a -1/-1 counter on it. However, because it's a new object with no relation to its previous existence, the returned creature will not have persist.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This works even if the opponent's lands are tapped. It only checks what kinds of mana can be produced, not if the abilities that produce them are usable right now.
2004/10/04: The ability can be activated if the opponent has no lands that produce mana, but the effect will not be able to generate any mana.
2004/10/04: It only produces one mana even if the land can produce more than one.
2009/10/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. Fellwar Stone can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/10/01: Fellwar Stone checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control Fellwar Stone, you can tap Fellwar Stone for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/10/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: Fellwar Stone doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>

～班特栽果人普兰</ChineseFlavor>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420912</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. Exotic Orchard can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/02/01: Exotic Orchard checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control Exotic Orchard, you can tap Exotic Orchard for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/02/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, Exotic Orchard takes into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there are more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/02/01: Exotic Orchard doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.
2009/02/01: Lands that produce mana based only on what other lands "could produce" won't help each other unless some other land allows one of them to actually produce some type of mana. For example, if you control an Exotic Orchard and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard and a Reflecting Pool, none of those lands would produce mana if their mana abilities were activated. On the other hand, if you control a Forest and an Exotic Orchard, and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard and a Reflecting Pool, then each of those lands can be tapped to produce {G}. Your opponent's Exotic Orchard can produce {G} because you control a Forest. Your Exotic Orchard and your opponent's Reflecting Pool can each produce {G} because your opponent's Exotic Orchard can produce {G}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: At the time the ability resolves, you'll get to play the card if you declared three different creatures as attackers at any point in the turn. A creature declared as an attacker in two different attack phases counts only once. A creature that entered the battlefield attacking (such as a token created by Militia's Pride) doesn't count because you never attacked with it.</Rulings>
