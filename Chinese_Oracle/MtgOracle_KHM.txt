2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.

2021/02/05: If you return an Aura this way, you choose what the Aura will enchant just before it enters the battlefield. An Aura returning to the battlefield this way doesn't target the player or permanent it will enchant, so permanents or players with hexproof may be chosen; however, the chosen recipient must be able to legally be enchanted by the Aura, so a player or permanent with protection from one of the Aura's qualities can't be chosen this way. If there's nothing legal for the Aura to enchant, it stays in the graveyard.

2021/02/05: Once you announce that you're casting Stalwart Valkyrie using its alternative cost, no player may take other actions until the spell's been paid for. Notably, players can't try to remove creature cards from your graveyard to stop you from casting the spell.
2021/02/05: Stalwart Valkyrie has converted mana cost 4, no matter what you actually paid to cast it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Starnheim Courser). The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/02/05: The cost reduction applies only to generic mana in the costs of artifact and enchantment spells you cast. It can't reduce requirements of specific colors of mana.</Rulings>

2021/02/05: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2021/02/05: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2021/02/05: The mana value of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the mana value of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2021/02/05: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2021/02/05: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2021/02/05: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.
2021/02/05: The words "revealed this way" were inadvertently omitted from the printed card. Alrund's current Oracle text appears above.
2021/02/05: Alrund's first ability applies only while Alrund is on the battlefield. In every other zone, Alrund is 1/1.

<Rulings>2021/02/05: None of Ascendant Spirit's abilities has a duration. If one of them resolves, it will remain in effect until Ascendant Spirit leaves the battlefield or a subsequent effect changes its characteristics.
2021/02/05: The first and second abilities cause Ascendant Spirit to lose any other creature types it may have. It retains any card types or supertypes it may have.
2021/02/05: The first and second abilities overwrite any previous effects that set Ascendant Spirit's base power and toughness to specific values. Any effects that set Ascendant Spirit's base power and toughness that start to apply after one of these abilities will override the effect of that ability.
2021/02/05: Activating the second ability after Ascendant Spirit has already been legally blocked by a creature without flying or reach won't change or undo that block.
2021/02/05: Any effects that modify Ascendant Spirit's power or toughness without setting it to a specific value will apply after its base power and toughness are set, regardless of the order in which those effects were created. The same is true of counters that modify its power and toughness.
2021/02/05: Any of Ascendant Spirit's abilities may be activated repeatedly. Multiple flying counters on the same permanent provide no additional benefit; however, each time the last ability resolves while Ascendant Spirit is an Angel will give Ascendant Spirit two more +1/+1 counters and cause it to gain another instance of the triggered ability. All of those instances trigger separately.
2021/02/05: Snow is a supertype, not a card type. It has no rules meaning or function by itself, but spells and abilities may refer to it.

2021/02/05: Snow isn't a type of mana. If an effect says you may spend mana as though it were any type, you can't pay for {S} using mana that wasn't produced by a snow source.
2021/02/05: Some cards have additional effects for each {S} spent to cast them. You can cast these spells even if you don't spend any snow mana to cast them; their additional effects simply won't do anything.

<CardText>When Berg Strider enters the battlefield, tap target artifact or creature an opponent controls. If {S} was spent to cast this spell, that permanent doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step. ({S} is mana from a snow source.)</CardText>
<Artist>Filip Burburan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503654</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: Spending more than one snow mana to cast Berg Strider won't cause the artifact or creature to remain tapped for additional turns.
2021/02/05: The enters-the-battlefield ability can target an artifact or creature an opponent controls that's already tapped. If snow mana was spent to cast Berg Strider, the target won't untap during its controller's next untap step.
2021/02/05: If Berg Strider enters the battlefield without being cast, no mana was spent to cast it. The enters-the-battlefield ability may still tap the target, but that permanent won't be stopped from untapping during its controller's next untap step.
2021/02/05: Similarly, if an effect copies the creature spell that becomes Berg Strider, no mana was spent to cast the copy. The target won't be stopped from untapping during its controller's next untap step.
2021/02/05: Snow is a supertype, not a card type. It has no rules meaning or function by itself, but spells and abilities may refer to it.
2021/02/05: The {S} symbol is a generic mana symbol. It represents a cost that can be paid by one mana that was produced by a snow source. That mana can be any color or colorless.
2021/02/05: Snow isn't a type of mana. If an effect says you may spend mana as though it were any type, you can't pay for {S} using mana that wasn't produced by a snow source.
2021/02/05: Some cards have additional effects for each {S} spent to cast them. You can cast these spells even if you don't spend any snow mana to cast them; their additional effects simply won't do anything.
2021/02/05: The Kaldheim set doesn't have any cards with mana costs that include {S}, but some previous sets do. If an effect says such a spell costs {1} less to cast, that reduction doesn't apply to any {S} costs. This is also true for activated abilities that include {S} in their activation costs and effects that reduce those costs.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2021/02/05: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2021/02/05: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2021/02/05: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2021/02/05: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2021/02/05: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.
2021/02/05: Cosima's ability triggers only if Cosima is on the battlefield at the beginning of your upkeep, and you may exile Cosima only if it is still on the battlefield as the ability resolves.
2021/02/05: While the triggered ability Cosima gains is resolving, if you don't put a voyage counter on Cosima, you'll immediately return it to the battlefield and draw cards equal to the number of voyage counters Cosima had on it in exile. Players can't respond to this choice, and no player may take actions during this process.
2021/02/05: You may choose to return Cosima to the battlefield even if it doesn't have any voyage counters on it. If you do, it won't enter with any +1/+1 counters on it and you won't draw any cards.
2021/02/05: If a land enters the battlefield under your control while Cosima is exiled and has the added triggered ability, that ability will trigger. As the ability tries to resolve, it will check to see if Cosima is still in exile. If Cosima has left exile before the ability tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. This is true even if Cosima returns to exile before that ability tries to resolve.

<Rulings>2021/02/05: While you control Cosmos Charger, you can foretell cards any time you have priority.
2021/02/05: The cost reduction refers to the cost you pay as you exile the card from your hand face down, not the cost you pay as you cast the spell from exile.
2021/02/05: If you control two Cosmos Chargers, you can foretell cards from your hand by paying {0}. Additional Cosmos Chargers won't affect this cost further.
2021/02/05: Cosmos Charger's third ability applies only if it's on the battlefield. Notably, it doesn't affect when you can foretell Cosmos Charger itself or how much you pay to do so.
2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.
2021/02/05: Casting a foretold card from exile follows the timing rules for that card. If you foretell an instant card, you can cast it as soon as the next player's turn. In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.
2021/02/05: If you're casting a foretold card from exile for its foretell cost, you can't choose to cast it for any other alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: Casting Glimpse the Cosmos from your graveyard using the last ability doesn't change when you can cast it.
2021/02/05: If you cast Glimpse the Cosmos from your graveyard using a different permission, the last ability won't apply. You'll pay whatever cost that permission stipulates, and you'll follow that permission's instructions regarding exiling Glimpse the Cosmos, if any.
2021/02/05: If Glimpse the Cosmos resolves during your turn and is put into your graveyard, you receive priority before any other player does. You can cast Glimpse the Cosmos again from your graveyard using the last ability before any player can attempt to remove it from your graveyard.
2021/02/05: Glimpse the Cosmos has converted mana cost 2, no matter what you actually paid to cast it.</Rulings>

The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.

<Rulings>2021/02/05: The mana can be spent to exile a card with foretell from your hand face down, not to cast the foretold card from exile (unless it's an instant or sorcery spell).
2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.
2021/02/05: Casting a foretold card from exile follows the timing rules for that card. If you foretell an instant card, you can cast it as soon as the next player's turn. In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.
2021/02/05: If you're casting a foretold card from exile for its foretell cost, you can't choose to cast it for any other alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: Three creatures share a creature type if there's at least one creature type all three have, no matter what other creature types they have. For example, Littjara Kinseekers (which has all creature types), an Elf Warrior, and an Elf Wizard share a creature type because they're all Elves.
2021/02/05: If you don't control three or more creatures that share a creature type immediately after Littjara Kinseekers enters the battlefield, its ability doesn't trigger. If you don't control three or more as the ability resolves, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on Littjara Kinseekers or scry 1. The three shared-type creatures you control when the ability resolves don't have to be the same three you controlled when the ability triggered.
2021/02/05: You put just one +1/+1 counter on Littjara Kinseekers and scry 1, no matter how many extra trios of creatures that share a creature type you control.
2021/02/05: Changeling is a characteristic-defining ability. It functions in all zones, not only while a card that has it is on the battlefield.
2021/02/05: The subtype Shapeshifter that appears on the type line is mostly there to reinforce the flavor. A creature card with changeling is just as much an Elf, a Dwarf, a Sliver, a Goat, a Coward, and a Zombie as it is a Shapeshifter.

2021/02/05: If an effect causes a creature with changeling to lose all abilities, it will remain all creature types, even though it will no longer have changeling. This is because changeling applies before the effect that removes it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: If more than one Mystic Reflection applies to the same permanent entering the battlefield, the controller of that permanent chooses the order of those copy effects. The copy effect they apply last will determine which creature the entering permanent copies.
2021/02/05: In most cases, the copiable values of the target creature won't change between Mystic Reflection resolving and the next time one or more creatures or planeswalkers enter the battlefield. In some unusual cases, they might, and if they do, use the copiable values of the creature at the time the permanents enter the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If Mystic Reflection resolves, but the target creature leaves the battlefield before the next time one or more creatures or planeswalkers enter the battlefield, use the copiable values of the target creature as it last existed on the battlefield to determine what the entering permanents copy.
2021/02/05: The entering permanents don't copy whether the target creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it, whether it has any Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2021/02/05: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the permanents enter the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the target creature will also work.
2021/02/05: Replacement effects that modify how a creature enters the battlefield are applied in the following order: first, control-changing effects (such as Gather Specimens), then copy effects (such as the abilities of Mystic Reflection and Clone), then all other effects.
2021/02/05: If a creature such as Clone is entering the battlefield under your control, there will be two copy effects to apply: the creature's own and Mystic Reflection's. No matter which order these effects are applied in, the creature will be a copy of the target creature when it enters the battlefield.
2021/02/05: Other enters-the-battlefield replacement abilities printed on the creatures entering the battlefield won't be applied because those permanents will already be copies of the target creature at that point (and therefore they won't have those abilities). External abilities may still affect how those permanents enter the battlefield. For example, if another effect says, "Creatures enter the battlefield tapped," the permanents will enter as tapped copies of the target creature.
2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.

<CardText>Changeling
Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, if it targets one or more other permanents you control, create a token that's a copy of one of those permanents.
When a spell or ability an opponent controls causes you to discard this card, create a token that's a copy of target permanent.</CardText>
<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503678</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: Orvar's first triggered ability resolves (if it resolves; see below) before the spell or ability that caused it to trigger.
2021/02/05: For the first triggered ability, the instant or sorcery spell can target other things if it also targets one or more permanents you control; however, the token you create can copy only permanents you control that are targets of the spell. If the spell targets more than one permanent you control, you choose which permanent the token is copying as you create the token.
2021/02/05: As the first triggered ability tries to resolve, the spell that caused it to trigger and that spell's targets are checked again. Ignore any target of the spell that has left the battlefield by that point. If all of the permanents you controlled that were targets have left the battlefield by that point, the triggered ability will do nothing and no token will be created. If at least one permanent you control that's a target is still on the battlefield, the triggered ability will resolve, even if that permanent is now an illegal target for the spell.
2021/02/05: If the spell itself has left the stack by that point, use the targets it had when it left the stack to perform the check described above.
2021/02/05: For the second triggered ability, you can choose any permanent as the target, regardless of who controls it.
2021/02/05: The token copies exactly what is printed on the permanent and nothing else (unless that permanent is a token or is copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it, whether it has any Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2021/02/05: If the permanent being copied is itself a token, the token created by the last ability copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
2021/02/05: If the permanent being copied is copying something else, the token you create will use the copiable values of the that permanent. In most cases, it will be a copy of whatever the permanent is copying. If it's copying a permanent or card with {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2021/02/05: If the permanent being copied has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2021/02/05: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[This permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied permanent will also work.
2021/02/05: If a spell or ability an opponent controls allows or instructs you to choose a card to discard, and you discard Orvar, its last ability will trigger.
2021/02/05: Changeling is a characteristic-defining ability. It functions in all zones, not only while a card that has it is on the battlefield.

2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.
2021/02/05: Casting a foretold card from exile follows the timing rules for that card. If you foretell an instant card, you can cast it as soon as the next player's turn. In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.
2021/02/05: If you're casting a foretold card from exile for its foretell cost, you can't choose to cast it for any other alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.</Rulings>

2021/02/05: The token that a resolving copy of a permanent spell becomes isn't "created." Abilities that refer to a copy being created won't interact with the copy resolving.

<Artist>Martina Fackova</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503687</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: You choose a mode for Blood on the Snow as you cast it. The last part of the effect (returning a card to the battlefield) happens no matter which mode you choose.
2021/02/05: Blood on the Snow doesn't target any creature or planeswalker card in your graveyard. You choose which one to return to the battlefield, if any, as Blood on the Snow resolves. Notably, you could return one of the creatures or planeswalkers that was just destroyed by Blood on the Snow.
2021/02/05: If a card in a graveyard has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2021/02/05: If you cast Blood on the Snow without spending snow mana, you can return only a creature or planeswalker card with mana value 0. (Planeswalker cards with mana value 0 likely not coming soon.)
2021/02/05: If Blood on the Snow is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so you can return only a creature or planeswalker card with mana value 0.
2021/02/05: Snow is a supertype, not a card type. It has no rules meaning or function by itself, but spells and abilities may refer to it.
2021/02/05: The {S} symbol is a generic mana symbol. It represents a cost that can be paid by one mana that was produced by a snow source. That mana can be any color or colorless.
2021/02/05: Snow isn't a type of mana. If an effect says you may spend mana as though it were any type, you can't pay for {S} using mana that wasn't produced by a snow source.
2021/02/05: Some cards have additional effects for each {S} spent to cast them. You can cast these spells even if you don't spend any snow mana to cast them; their additional effects simply won't do anything.
2021/02/05: The Kaldheim set doesn't have any cards with mana costs that include {S}, but some previous sets do. If an effect says such a spell costs {1} less to cast, that reduction doesn't apply to any {S} costs.

<CardText>Each nonland card in your hand without foretell has foretell. Its foretell cost is equal to its mana cost reduced by {2}. (During your turn, you may pay {2} and exile it from your hand face down. Cast it on a later turn for its foretell cost.)
Whenever you foretell a card, Dream Devourer gets +2/+0 until end of turn.</CardText>
<Artist>David Rapoza</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503698</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: It doesn't matter if Dream Devourer is still on the battlefield or still under your control as you cast the spell from exile.
2021/02/05: Cards that are foretold by virtue of Dream Devourer's ability won't continue to have the foretell ability once they leave your hand, but you can still cast them from exile on a later turn for the foretell costs they were given by Dream Devourer.
2021/02/05: The reduction of the foretell cost applies only to generic mana in the foretell cost. It can't reduce requirements of specific colors of mana. For example, if you foretell a card in your hand with mana cost {1}{G}{G}, its foretell cost will be {G}{G}.
2021/02/05: If you foretell a modal double-faced card, the foretell cost will be based on the mana cost of the face you cast from exile. For example, if you foretell Kolvori, God of Kinship/The Ringhart Crest, you can cast Kolvori by paying {G}{G} or The Ringhart Crest by paying {G} on a future turn. If you foretell a modal double-faced card whose front face is a nonland face but whose back face is a land face, you can't play that card as a land.
2021/02/05: The last ability triggers when you exile a card from your hand using foretell, not when you cast a foretold card from exile.
2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.
2021/02/05: Casting a foretold card from exile follows the timing rules for that card. If you foretell an instant card, you can cast it as soon as the next player's turn. In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.

<Rulings>2021/02/05: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2021/02/05: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2021/02/05: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2021/02/05: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2021/02/05: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2021/02/05: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.
2021/02/05: You choose which cards you're exiling as Egon's triggered ability is resolving. If there are two or more cards in your graveyard at that time, you must exile two of them. You can't choose not to exile cards and sacrifice Egon instead to draw a card.
2021/02/05: If there's only one card in your graveyard, you won't exile it. Because you can't exile two cards from your graveyard, you'll sacrifice Egon and draw a card.
2021/02/05: If Egon leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, you'll still exile two cards from your graveyard if you can and draw a card if you can't.
2021/02/05: Although players may respond to Throne of Death's activated ability, they can't respond to the paying of its activation cost. The creature card will already be exiled by the time anyone can respond.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: If you choose the second mode, the cards must share at least one creature type, such as Knight or Djinn. Card types (e.g., artifact) and supertypes (e.g., legendary or snow) aren't creature types.
2021/02/05: If you choose the second mode and one of the two cards leaves your graveyard, you'll still return the other card to your hand as long as it has a creature type that the other card had as it left your graveyard.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: You check if the creature is an Elf once it's on the battlefield. You'll create tokens if it is, even if the card in the graveyard wasn't an Elf card.
2021/02/05: Players can't take any actions in between the card returning to the battlefield and Elf Warrior tokens being created.
2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.
2021/02/05: Casting a foretold card from exile follows the timing rules for that card. If you foretell an instant card, you can cast it as soon as the next player's turn. In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.
2021/02/05: If you're casting a foretold card from exile for its foretell cost, you can't choose to cast it for any other alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2021/02/05: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2021/02/05: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2021/02/05: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2021/02/05: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2021/02/05: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.
2021/02/05: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2021/02/05: If an opponent sacrifices a nontoken permanent, it doesn't matter which graveyard it goes to. Tergrid's ability will trigger.
2021/02/05: If the card leaves the graveyard before Tergrid's ability resolves, you can't put it onto the battlefield, even if it returns to the graveyard before the ability resolves.
2021/02/05: If an opponent sacrifices a nontoken permanent or discards a permanent card as part of paying the cost of a spell or ability, Tergrid's ability will trigger and goes on the stack on top of that spell or ability. Tergrid's ability will resolve before that spell or ability.
2021/02/05: If you put an Aura onto the battlefield using Tergrid's ability, you choose what the Aura will enchant just before it enters the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target the player or permanent it will enchant, so permanents or players with hexproof may be chosen; however, the chosen recipient must be able to legally be enchanted by the Aura, so a player or permanent with protection from one of the Aura's qualities can't be chosen this way. If there's nothing legal for the Aura to enchant, it stays in the graveyard.
2021/02/05: The player targeted by the first ability of Tergrid's Lantern can choose to lose 3 life even if they have nonland permanents to sacrifice or cards to discard. They can't choose to sacrifice a nonland permanent if they don't control any, nor can they choose to discard a card if they have none in hand.</Rulings>

2021/02/05: If Valki leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, each opponent will reveal their hand, but no cards will be exiled.
2021/02/05: You don't choose which creature card exiled with Valki that Valki will become a copy of until that ability is resolving. (In many cases, the value you chose for X will give away your intentions.)

2021/02/05: Valki copies the printed values of the exiled creature card. Notably, once Valki becomes a copy of another creature card, he won't have his own printed activated ability.
2021/02/05: You can activate Valki's ability multiple times in response to one another. This may briefly allow Valki to copy different creature cards. You'll get priority to cast spells or activate abilities in between each of Valki's activated abilities.

2021/02/05: The emblem given to you by Tibalt allows you to play cards exiled with that specific Tibalt, Cosmic Impostor, even after that Tibalt leaves the battlefield. If a different Tibalt, Cosmic Impostor comes under your control, it's a new object (even if it's represented by the same card). Of course, the new Tibalt will also give you an emblem so you can play the cards he exiles.
2021/02/05: The cards exiled by Tibalt's loyalty abilities are all exiled face up.
2021/02/05: Playing the cards exiled with Tibalt follows the normal rules for playing those cards. You must pay their costs, if any, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if one of the cards is a sorcery card, you can cast that card by paying its mana cost only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2021/02/05: Unless an effect allows you to play additional lands that turn, you can play land cards exiled with Tibalt only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.

2021/02/05: If there are no creature cards exiled with Valki with converted mana cost equal to the value of X as Valki's activated ability resolves, nothing happens. God of Lies, indeed.
2021/02/05: If Valki becomes a copy of a creature during the same turn Valki enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any {T} abilities he gains.
2021/02/05: Valki copies the printed values of the exiled creature card. Notably, once Valki becomes a copy of another creature card, he won't have his own printed activated ability.
2021/02/05: You can activate Valki's ability multiple times in response to one another. This may briefly allow Valki to copy different creature cards. You'll get priority to cast spells or activate abilities in between each of Valki's activated abilities.
2021/02/05: If an effect begins to apply to Valki before it becomes a copy, that effect will continue to apply.
2021/02/05: If another object becomes a copy of Valki, it will become whatever Valki is copying. That object remains a copy even if Valki leaves the battlefield.
2021/02/05: The emblem given to you by Tibalt allows you to play cards exiled with that specific Tibalt, Cosmic Impostor, even after that Tibalt leaves the battlefield. If a different Tibalt, Cosmic Impostor comes under your control, it's a new object (even if it's represented by the same card). Of course, the new Tibalt will also give you an emblem so you can play the cards he exiles.
2021/02/05: The cards exiled by Tibalt's loyalty abilities are all exiled face up.
2021/02/05: Playing the cards exiled with Tibalt follows the normal rules for playing those cards. You must pay their costs, if any, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if one of the cards is a sorcery card, you can cast that card by paying its mana cost only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2021/02/05: Unless an effect allows you to play additional lands that turn, you can play land cards exiled with Tibalt only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2021/02/05: While resolving Tibalt's last ability, you'll add {R}{R}{R} even if you don't exile any cards.
2021/02/05: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2021/02/05: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2021/02/05: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2021/02/05: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2021/02/05: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2021/02/05: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.
2021/02/05: Casting a foretold card from exile follows the timing rules for that card. If you foretell an instant card, you can cast it as soon as the next player's turn. In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.
2021/02/05: If you're casting a foretold card from exile for its foretell cost, you can't choose to cast it for any other alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: Dual Strike will copy any instant or sorcery spell with converted mana cost 4 or less, not just one that requires targets.
2021/02/05: A copy is created even if the spell you cast has been countered or otherwise left the stack by the time the copy ability resolves. The copy will resolve before the original spell.
2021/02/05: If you copy a spell with targets, the copy will have the same targets unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for any of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, that target remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).

2021/02/05: If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, use the value of X to determine whether its converted mana cost is 4 or less. If the spell is copied, the copy will have the same value of X.
2021/02/05: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed, although the targets receiving that damage still can. The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2021/02/05: You can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.

2021/02/05: The {S} symbol is a generic mana symbol. It represents a cost that can be paid by one mana that was produced by a snow source. That mana can be any color or colorless.
2021/02/05: Snow isn't a type of mana. If an effect says you may spend mana as though it were any type, you can't pay for {S} using mana that wasn't produced by a snow source.
2021/02/05: Some cards have additional effects for each {S} spent to cast them. You can cast these spells even if you don't spend any snow mana to cast them; their additional effects simply won't do anything.
2021/02/05: The Kaldheim set doesn't have any cards with mana costs that include {S}, but some previous sets do.

The Rune's enters-the-battlefield ability will trigger, and you'll draw a card. The Rune won't do anything while the Vehicle isn't a creature, but if it becomes one later, the appropriate ability will start applying.
2021/02/05: If the target of an Aura spell is an illegal target as that spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve, it won't enter the battlefield, and none of its enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities will trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2021/02/05: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2021/02/05: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2021/02/05: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2021/02/05: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2021/02/05: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.
2021/02/05: A creature has been dealt excess damage if one or more sources deal more damage to it than the minimum amount of damage required to be lethal damage. In most cases, this means damage greater than its toughness, but consider any damage already dealt to it that turn.
2021/02/05: A planeswalker is dealt excess damage if it's dealt damage greater than its current loyalty.
2021/02/05: Even 1 damage dealt to a creature from a source with deathtouch is considered lethal damage, so any amount greater than that will cause excess damage to be dealt, even if the total amount of damage isn't greater than the creature's toughness. Note that a source of damage having deathtouch has no effect on damage dealt to planeswalkers.
2021/02/05: If a permanent is both a creature and a planeswalker, the minimum amount of damage to be considered lethal damage is used to determine if excess damage has been dealt. For example, if a 5/5 creature that's also a planeswalker with three loyalty counters on it is dealt 4 noncombat damage, it's been dealt 1 excess damage and Toralf's ability will trigger.
2021/02/05: It doesn't matter if a creature or planeswalker an opponent controls was dealt combat damage earlier in the turn. The only thing that matters is that the damage dealt to that permanent that caused excess damage to be dealt was noncombat damage.
2021/02/05: Toralf's ability doesn't affect the damage dealt to the creature or planeswalker an opponent controls. That damage will still be dealt as normal.
2021/02/05: The damage Toralf deals because of its triggered ability is noncombat damage. That damage may cause Toralf's ability to trigger again.
2021/02/05: The creature equipped by Toralf's Hammer is the source of the activated ability, but Toralf's Hammer is the source of the damage. For example, if the equipped creature is green, that ability can't target a permanent with protection from green. It could target one with protection from red, though the damage would be prevented as it would have been dealt by a red source (Toralf's Hammer).
2021/02/05: If the target is an illegal target as the ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't return Toralf's Hammer to its owner's hand.
2021/02/05: You unattach Toralf's Hammer as part of the cost of activating the ability. If the ability doesn't resolve, Toralf's Hammer doesn't become reattached.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: Battle Mammoth's triggered ability resolves before the spell or ability that caused it to trigger. It will resolve even if that spell or ability is countered.
2021/02/05: If a spell or ability an opponent controls targets a single permanent you control more than once, Battle Mammoth's triggered ability will trigger only once. However, if a spell or ability an opponent controls targets multiple permanents you control, Battle Mammoth's triggered ability will trigger once for each of those permanents.
2021/02/05: You choose whether to draw a card as Battle Mammoth's triggered ability is resolving.
2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.
2021/02/05: Casting a foretold card from exile follows the timing rules for that card. If you foretell an instant card, you can cast it as soon as the next player's turn. In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.
2021/02/05: If you're casting a foretold card from exile for its foretell cost, you can't choose to cast it for any other alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.</Rulings>

2021/02/05: You determine how many creatures you control with power 4 or greater as Blessing of Frost is resolving, after +1/+1 counters have been put on creatures.
2021/02/05: If you cast Blessing of Frost without spending snow mana, no +1/+1 counters will be distributed. You may still draw cards if your creatures are large enough.
2021/02/05: If Blessing of Frost is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so no +1/+1 counters will be distributed. You may still draw cards if your creatures are large enough.
2021/02/05: Snow is a supertype, not a card type. It has no rules meaning or function by itself, but spells and abilities may refer to it.
2021/02/05: The {S} symbol is a generic mana symbol. It represents a cost that can be paid by one mana that was produced by a snow source. That mana can be any color or colorless.

2021/02/05: Some cards have additional effects for each {S} spent to cast them. You can cast these spells even if you don't spend any snow mana to cast them; their additional effects simply won't do anything.
2021/02/05: The Kaldheim set doesn't have any cards with mana costs that include {S}, but some previous sets do. If an effect says such a spell costs {1} less to cast, that reduction doesn't apply to any {S} costs. This is also true for activated abilities that include {S} in their activation costs and effects that reduce those costs.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>503776</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: Unlike effects that care only whether or not you spent snow mana to cast a spell, Boreal Outrider cares about the color of that snow mana. It doesn't matter which part of the total cost to cast the creature spell the snow mana was spent on, only that the spent snow mana matches one of the creature spell's colors. For example, if a red creature spell has an additional cost to cast it and you spend red mana from a snow source to pay that cost, Boreal Outrider's ability will trigger.
2021/02/05: A creature affected by Boreal Outrider's triggered ability will enter with only one additional +1/+1 counter on it, even if you spent more than one snow mana of the appropriate color(s) to cast it.
2021/02/05: If you control multiple Boreal Outriders, each of their triggered abilities will trigger separately. A creature could enter the battlefield with multiple +1/+1 counters on it this way, even if you spent only a single snow mana of the appropriate color(s) to cast the creature spell.

If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.

<Rulings>2021/02/05: You can activate Icehide Troll's last ability even if it's already tapped.
2021/02/05: Snow is a supertype, not a card type. It has no rules meaning or function by itself, but spells and abilities may refer to it.
2021/02/05: The {S} symbol is a generic mana symbol. It represents a cost that can be paid by one mana that was produced by a snow source. That mana can be any color or colorless.
2021/02/05: Snow isn't a type of mana. If an effect says you may spend mana as though it were any type, you can't pay for {S} using mana that wasn't produced by a snow source.
2021/02/05: Some cards have additional effects for each {S} spent to cast them. You can cast these spells even if you don't spend any snow mana to cast them; their additional effects simply won't do anything.
2021/02/05: The Kaldheim set doesn't have any cards with mana costs that include {S}, but some previous sets do. If an effect says such a spell costs {1} less to cast, that reduction doesn't apply to any {S} costs. This is also true for activated abilities that include {S} in their activation costs and effects that reduce those costs.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: A permanent spell is an artifact spell, a creature spell, an enchantment spell, or a planeswalker spell.
2021/02/05: Consider the other permanents you control as the triggered ability resolves to determine which spell you can cast. If the only other permanents you control are lands, or in the unlikely event you don't control any other permanents, you may cast a permanent spell with converted mana cost 1 from your hand.
2021/02/05: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.
2021/02/05: If a permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2021/02/05: If the spell you cast has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: Even though you may play the card, it isn't in your hand, so you can't, for example, discard it or foretell it.
2021/02/05: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2021/02/05: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2021/02/05: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2021/02/05: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2021/02/05: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2021/02/05: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.
2021/02/05: Snow is a supertype, not a card type. It has no rules meaning or function by itself, but spells and abilities may refer to it.

2021/02/05: Jorn's triggered ability will untap Jorn itself.
2021/02/05: A snow permanent card is any artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card with the supertype snow.
2021/02/05: You don't play the card as Kaldring's activated ability is resolving; rather, that ability gives you permission to play that card that turn. You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions for the card when you play it. To play a land this way, you must have a land play available. Notably, if you activate Kaldring's ability during an opponent's turn, you won't be able to cast a spell that way unless it has flash and you won't be able to play a land that way at all.
2021/02/05: You'll still pay all costs to cast a spell this way, including any additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs if any are available.
2021/02/05: If you don't end up playing the card, it remains in your graveyard. You can't play it on future turns unless you target it again with Kaldring's ability (or something else lets you play it).</Rulings>

In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.

The resulting permanent will also retain its name, colors, and supertypes, but it will be an Aura enchantment with no other types or subtypes.</Rulings>

<CardText>Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
As Realmwalker enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.
You may look at the top card of your library any time.
You may cast creature spells of the chosen type from the top of your library.</CardText>
<Artist>Zack Stella</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503804</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: You must choose an existing creature type, such as Elk or Advisor. You can't choose card types (e.g., artifact) or supertypes (e.g., snow).
2021/02/05: If Realmwalker is somehow on the battlefield with no choice having been made for it, you may still look at the top card of your library any time. You won't be able to cast any creature spells from the top of your library, even if they have no creature types.
2021/02/05: You can look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction; see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
2021/02/05: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish doing so. This means that if you cast a spell from the top of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
2021/02/05: Realmwalker doesn't change when you can cast creature spells. Normally, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty, although flash may change this.
2021/02/05: You'll still pay all costs for the spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs if any are available.
2021/02/05: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't foretell it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2021/02/05: Changeling is a characteristic-defining ability. It functions in all zones, not only while a card that has it is on the battlefield.
2021/02/05: The subtype Shapeshifter that appears on the type line is mostly there to reinforce the flavor. A creature card with changeling is just as much an Elf, a Dwarf, a Sliver, a Goat, a Coward, and a Zombie as it is a Shapeshifter.
2021/02/05: If an effect causes a creature with changeling to become a new creature type, it will be only that new creature type. It will still have changeling; the effect making it all creature types will simply be overwritten.
2021/02/05: If an effect causes a creature with changeling to lose all abilities, it will remain all creature types, even though it will no longer have changeling. This is because changeling applies before the effect that removes it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503816</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: A creature has been dealt excess damage if one or more sources deal more damage to it than the minimum amount of damage required to be lethal damage. In most cases, this means damage greater than its toughness, but consider the damage already dealt to it that turn.
2021/02/05: A planeswalker is dealt excess damage if it's dealt damage greater than its current loyalty.
2021/02/05: Even 1 damage dealt to a creature from a source with deathtouch is considered lethal damage, so any amount greater than that will cause excess damage to be dealt, even if the total amount of damage isn't greater than the creature's toughness. Note that a source of damage having deathtouch has no effect on damage dealt to planeswalkers.
2021/02/05: It doesn't matter whether a Giant, Wizard, or spell you control deals the excess damage, only that excess damage was dealt and that one of those three things dealt damage to the creature or planeswalker at some point during the turn. For example, if a 4/4 creature an opponent controls is dealt 2 damage by a spell you control and later that turn is dealt 3 damage by a spell another player controls, Aegar's ability will trigger.
2021/02/05: If a permanent is both a creature and a planeswalker, the minimum amount of damage to be considered lethal damage is used to determine if excess damage has been dealt. For example, if a 5/5 creature that's also a planeswalker with three loyalty counters on it is dealt 4 damage, it's been dealt 1 excess damage and Aegar's ability may trigger.</Rulings>

2021/02/05: If you choose no targets for the chapter II ability, you'll simply add {R} as the ability resolves. However, if you do choose a target creature you control, and that creature is an illegal target as the ability resolves, the ability won't resolve. You won't add {R} in that case.

2021/02/05: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2021/02/05: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2021/02/05: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the chapter III ability to trigger, but chapters I and II won't trigger again.
2021/02/05: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2021/02/05: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives more lore counters.
2021/02/05: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

I, II — Choose a creature you control. Until your next turn, all damage that would be dealt to creatures you control is dealt to that creature instead.

<Multiverseid>503818</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: You choose a creature for the chapter I/II ability as that ability resolves.
2021/02/05: If the chosen creature isn't on the battlefield at the time damage would be dealt to creatures you control, that damage is dealt to whichever creature(s) it was supposed to be dealt to. It won't be redirected.
2021/02/05: The chapter I/II ability doesn't change whether the damage is combat damage or not. If combat damage would be dealt to a creature you control, the damage that's dealt instead to the chosen creature is still combat damage.
2021/02/05: If another player gains control of the chosen creature after the chapter I/II ability resolves but before your next turn, damage that would be dealt to creatures you control will still be dealt to that creature instead.
2021/02/05: The creature card put onto the battlefield by the chapter III ability will enter the battlefield as a flying Angel Warrior (in addition to whatever other creature types it has).
2021/02/05: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2021/02/05: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability.

<CardText>(As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
I — Create a 1/1 white Human Warrior creature token.
II — Create a 1/1 green Elf Warrior creature token.
III — Choose any number of artifact tokens and/or creature tokens you control with different names. For each of them, create a token that's a copy of it.</CardText>
<Artist>Igor Kieryluk</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503819</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: The chapter III ability doesn't target any of the tokens. You choose which ones you're copying as the ability resolves.
2021/02/05: Unless the effect that creates a token specifies a different name, the name of a token is the same as its creature types. In particular, a Human Warrior creature token has a different name than an Elf Warrior creature token, and you may create a copy of each using the chapter III ability.
2021/02/05: Each token you create copies the original characteristics of the token it's copying as stated by the effect that created that token. The newly created token doesn't copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it, whether it has any Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2021/02/05: If the original token is copying something else, the token you create will use the copiable values of the original token. In most cases, it will be a copy of whatever the original token is copying. If it's copying a permanent or card with {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2021/02/05: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of tokens you create will trigger when they enter the battlefield. Any "As [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[This permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the tokens will also work.
2021/02/05: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.

<Artist>Randy Gallegos</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503821</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: The chapter II ability overwrites any previous effects that set any of the Shapeshifters' base power and toughness to specific values. Any effects that set a Shapeshifter's base power and toughness that start to apply after the chapter II ability will override the effect of that ability.
2021/02/05: Any effects that modify the Shapeshifter's power or toughness without setting it to a specific value will apply after its base power and toughness are set, regardless of the order in which those effects were created. The same is true of counters that modify its power and toughness.
2021/02/05: The effect of the chapter II ability lasts indefinitely. It doesn't expire at end of turn.
2021/02/05: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.

2021/02/05: Changeling is a characteristic-defining ability. It functions in all zones, not only while a card that has it is on the battlefield.
2021/02/05: The subtype Shapeshifter that appears on the type line is mostly there to reinforce the flavor. A creature card with changeling is just as much an Elf, a Dwarf, a Sliver, a Goat, a Coward, and a Zombie as it is a Shapeshifter.
2021/02/05: If an effect causes a creature with changeling to become a new creature type, it will be only that new creature type. It will still have changeling; the effect making it all creature types will simply be overwritten.
2021/02/05: If an effect causes a creature with changeling to lose all abilities, it will remain all creature types, even though it will no longer have changeling. This is because changeling applies before the effect that removes it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2021/02/05: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2021/02/05: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the chapter III ability to trigger, but chapters I and II won't trigger again.
2021/02/05: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2021/02/05: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives more lore counters.
2021/02/05: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

<CardText>(As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
I — Mill three cards. You may put an Elf or Tyvar card from your graveyard onto the battlefield.

<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503829</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: For the chapter I ability, the Elf or Tyvar card you put onto the battlefield can be one of the cards you just milled, or it may be one that was already in your graveyard.
2021/02/05: Only Elves you control as the chapter II ability resolves will get a +1/+1 counter. Elves that come under your control later in the turn will not.
2021/02/05: Conversely, the triggered ability created by the chapter III ability will trigger whenever any Elf you control attacks that turn, even if you didn't control that Elf as the chapter III ability resolved.
2021/02/05: The triggered ability created by the chapter III ability resolves before blockers are declared. It may remove opposing creatures before they have the chance to block.

<Rulings>2021/02/05: Immersturm Predator's triggered ability doesn't allow you to tap Immersturm Predator. You have to find some other way to tap it. Let us suggest attacking.
2021/02/05: For the triggered ability to trigger, Immersturm Predator has to actually change from untapped to tapped. If an effect attempts to tap it while it is already tapped, the ability won't trigger.
2021/02/05: You can put the triggered ability on the stack without a target. As it resolves, you'll just put a +1/+1 counter on Immersturm Predator. However, if you do choose a target, and that card is an illegal target as the ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. In that case, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on Immersturm Predator.
2021/02/05: You can activate Immersturm Predator's last ability even if it's already tapped.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Felix</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503831</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: The chapter II ability goes on the stack without a target. You choose whether to reveal a Giant card from your hand after you have drawn a card. When you do, the reflexive triggered ability triggers. This is different than effects that say "If you do" in that players can respond after you've revealed the Giant card but before damage is dealt.
2021/02/05: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of the effect of the chapter III ability). The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/02/05: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.

<Multiverseid>503832</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: Kardur's first ability affects all creatures your opponents control, including any that enter the battlefield after the ability resolves.
2021/02/05: If a creature an opponent controls can't attack for some reason (such as being tapped or having come under its controller's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2021/02/05: If a creature an opponent controls doesn't qualify for any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than you if able. If the creature can't attack any of those players, or if there are no such players, it must attack you or an opposing planeswalker.
2021/02/05: If a creature affected by Kardur's ability could legally attack multiple players and/or planeswalkers, its controller chooses who it attacks.
2021/02/05: Kardur's last ability will trigger no matter who controlled the attacking creature and no matter who it was attacking.</Rulings>

2021/02/05: If you own a face-down card in exile, Kaya's emblem will let you cast it only if you can look at the card (and only if it's legendary). If you aren't allowed to look at the card, you can't cast it, even if you know it's legendary.
2021/02/05: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.

You may have Moritte of the Frost enter the battlefield as a copy of a permanent you control, except it's legendary and snow in addition to its other types and, if it's a creature, it enters with two additional +1/+1 counters on it and has changeling.</CardText>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503839</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: Moritte copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it, whether it has any Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2021/02/05: If Moritte copies a nonlegendary permanent, you'll control two permanents with same name, but only one of them (Moritte) will be legendary. You won't put any of them into their owner's graveyard.
2021/02/05: If the chosen permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2021/02/05: If the chosen permanent is a token, Moritte copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Moritte doesn't become a token in this case.
2021/02/05: If the chosen permanent is copying something else, Moritte will use the copiable values of the chosen permanent. In most cases, it will be a copy of whatever the chosen permanent is copying. If it's copying a permanent or card with {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2021/02/05: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when Moritte enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2021/02/05: If Moritte copies a creature, it enters with two +1/+1 counters on it, plus any counters that will be put on it by abilities it copied or abilities of other objects.
2021/02/05: If the copied permanent is affected by a type-changing effect, Moritte may enter the battlefield with different permanent types than the copied permanent currently has. Use the characteristics of Moritte as it enters the battlefield, not of the copied permanent, to determine whether it enters with an additional counter on it. Notably, if Moritte copies a permanent that's normally not a creature but has been made a creature by another effect, Moritte enters as a noncreature permanent that doesn't get +1/+1 counters or have changeling.
2021/02/05: If Moritte somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent, it can't become a copy of that permanent. You may choose only a permanent that's already on the battlefield.
2021/02/05: Snow is a supertype, not a card type. It has no rules meaning or function by itself, but spells and abilities may refer to it.
2021/02/05: The {S} symbol is a generic mana symbol. It represents a cost that can be paid by one mana that was produced by a snow source. That mana can be any color or colorless.
2021/02/05: Snow isn't a type of mana. If an effect says you may spend mana as though it were any type, you can't pay for {S} using mana that wasn't produced by a snow source.
2021/02/05: Some cards have additional effects for each {S} spent to cast them. You can cast these spells even if you don't spend any snow mana to cast them; their additional effects simply won't do anything.
2021/02/05: The Kaldheim set doesn't have any cards with mana costs that include {S}, but some previous sets do. If an effect says such a spell costs {1} less to cast, that reduction doesn't apply to any {S} costs. This is also true for activated abilities that include {S} in their activation costs and effects that reduce those costs.
2021/02/05: Changeling is a characteristic-defining ability. It functions in all zones, not only while a card that has it is on the battlefield.
2021/02/05: The subtype Shapeshifter that appears on the type line is mostly there to reinforce the flavor. A creature card with changeling is just as much an Elf, a Dwarf, a Sliver, a Goat, a Coward, and a Zombie as it is a Shapeshifter.
2021/02/05: If an effect causes a creature with changeling to become a new creature type, it will be only that new creature type. It will still have changeling; the effect making it all creature types will simply be overwritten.
2021/02/05: If an effect causes a creature with changeling to lose all abilities, it will remain all creature types, even though it will no longer have changeling. This is because changeling applies before the effect that removes it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Bastien L. Deharme</Artist>
<Multiverseid>503842</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: The mana added by the chapter II ability can be spent to cast a spell that has foretell no matter where you're casting it from. It doesn't have to be a foretold card you're casting from exile.
2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.
2021/02/05: Casting a foretold card from exile follows the timing rules for that card. If you foretell an instant card, you can cast it as soon as the next player's turn. In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.
2021/02/05: If you're casting a foretold card from exile for its foretell cost, you can't choose to cast it for any other alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.
2021/02/05: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2021/02/05: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2021/02/05: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the chapter III ability to trigger, but chapters I and II won't trigger again.
2021/02/05: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2021/02/05: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives more lore counters.
2021/02/05: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered.

If Sarulf doesn't have any +1/+1 counters on it at that time, the ability won't do anything. No other permanents will be exiled.
2021/02/05: If Sarulf isn't on the battlefield as its last ability starts to resolve, you can't remove any +1/+1 counters from it, even if it had +1/+1 counters when it was last on the battlefield. No other permanents will be exiled.
2021/02/05: Choosing to remove all the +1/+1 counters on Sarulf won't affect any other counters it may have.
2021/02/05: If you do remove +1/+1 counters, you must remove all of them. You can't fine-tune the carnage by only removing some of them.
2021/02/05: You choose whether to remove +1/+1 counters as the last ability is resolving. If you do, the appropriate permanents are then exiled. No one can respond to your choice or take actions during this process.
2021/02/05: You may choose to remove Sarulf's +1/+1 counters even if that would cause lethal damage to be marked on Sarulf. If you do this, Sarulf will die after its last ability is finished resolving. But it won't have gone alone! Legendary.</Rulings>

2021/02/05: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2021/02/05: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the chapter III ability to trigger, but chapters I and II won't trigger again.
2021/02/05: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2021/02/05: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives more lore counters.
2021/02/05: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

2021/02/05: If Bloodline Pretender enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, you can choose one of that creature's creature types and have Bloodline Pretender's last ability trigger for that other creature.

2021/02/05: Changeling is a characteristic-defining ability. It functions in all zones, not only while a card that has it is on the battlefield.
2021/02/05: The subtype Shapeshifter that appears on the type line is mostly there to reinforce the flavor. A creature card with changeling is just as much an Elf, a Dwarf, a Sliver, a Goat, a Coward, and a Zombie as it is a Shapeshifter.
2021/02/05: If an effect causes a creature with changeling to become a new creature type, it will be only that new creature type. It will still have changeling; the effect making it all creature types will simply be overwritten.
2021/02/05: If an effect causes a creature with changeling to lose all abilities, it will remain all creature types, even though it will no longer have changeling. This is because changeling applies before the effect that removes it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: The check of whether Replicating Ring has eight or more night counters on it happens only as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. If Replicating Ring picks up its eighth night counter at another time, you won't immediately create Replicated Rings. You'll have to wait until the next time the triggered ability resolves.
2021/02/05: Snow is a supertype, not a card type. It has no rules meaning or function by itself, but spells and abilities may refer to it.
2021/02/05: The {S} symbol is a generic mana symbol. It represents a cost that can be paid by one mana that was produced by a snow source. That mana can be any color or colorless.

<Multiverseid>503862</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/02/05: Because exiling a card with foretell from your hand is a special action, you can do so any time you have priority during your turn, including in response to spells and abilities. Once you announce you're taking the action, no other player can respond by trying to remove the card from your hand.
2021/02/05: Casting a foretold card from exile follows the timing rules for that card. If you foretell an instant card, you can cast it as soon as the next player's turn. In most cases, if you foretell a card that isn't an instant (or doesn't have flash), you'll have to wait until your next turn to cast it.
2021/02/05: If you're casting a foretold card from exile for its foretell cost, you can't choose to cast it for any other alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/02/05: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2021/02/05: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2021/02/05: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2021/02/05: The mana value of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the mana value of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2021/02/05: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2021/02/05: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2021/02/05: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2021/02/05: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.</Rulings>
