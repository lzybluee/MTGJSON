<CardText>Other Rogues you control get +1/+1.
Whenever one or more Rogues you control deal combat damage to a player, that player mills a card for each 1 damage dealt to them. If the player mills at least one creature card this way, you draw a card. (To mill a card, a player puts the top card of their library into their graveyard.)</CardText>

<Multiverseid>495893</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to other Rogues you control may become lethal if Anowon leaves the battlefield during that turn.
2020/09/25: The player dealt combat damage mills cards only for the damage dealt by your Rogues, not for any other combat damage dealt to them at the same time.
2020/09/25: You draw just one card, no matter how many creature cards the player mills beyond the first.
2020/09/25: If Rogues you control deal combat damage to two players at once, Anowon's ability triggers twice.</Rulings>

Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Chris Rallis</Artist>
<Multiverseid>495894</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: Obuun's first ability doesn't remove any abilities the land creature has.
2020/09/25: Obuun's first ability can target a land that's already a creature. This overwrites any previous effects that set the land creature's power and/or toughness to specific values. Other effects that set these characteristics to specific values that start to apply after the ability resolves will overwrite that part of the effect.
2020/09/25: Effects that modify the power or toughness of the land creature without setting it will apply to its new base power and toughness no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power and toughness.
2020/09/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2020/09/25: A landfall ability doesn't trigger if a permanent already on the battlefield becomes a land.
2020/09/25: Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.</Rulings>

<Artist>Victor Adame Minguez</Artist>
<Multiverseid>495896</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a prowl cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: You can cast a spell for its prowl cost any time in a turn after a creature you control of a matching type has dealt combat damage to a player. It doesn't matter if that player left the game, if that creature left the battlefield or left your control, or if that creature no longer has a matching type.
2020/09/25: Prowl compares the creature types of the spell with the creature types of the creatures that dealt combat damage to players this turn. Normally this means that you can cast Enigma Thief for its prowl cost only if a Sphinx or Rogue dealt combat damage to a player, but if an effect causes the spell to have other creature types, the prowl ability is also satisfied by a creature with those additional types having dealt combat damage to a player.
2020/09/25: If a nonland permanent changes control while it's the target of Enigma Thief's ability, that permanent won't be a legal target as the ability resolves. Any remaining legal targets will be returned to their owners' hand.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: You'll still pay all costs for a spell cast this way, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs if any are available.
2020/09/25: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells and/or permanents you control from Whispersteel Dagger's ability are exiled.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>495898</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: Creatures that enter the battlefield or come under the target player's control after Geode Rager's ability has resolved won't be goaded.
2020/09/25: If a goaded creature can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/09/25: If a goaded creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than a player who goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or a player who goaded it.
2020/09/25: Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded.
2020/09/25: Being goaded more than once by the same player is redundant.
2020/09/25: If you goad a creature you control, it must attack, and it must attack a player rather than a planeswalker.
2020/09/25: If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents who hasn't goaded it. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks.
2020/09/25: If you leave the game, any creatures you've goaded remain goaded until your next turn would have begun. They don't immediately stop being goaded and don't remain goaded indefinitely.
2020/09/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2020/09/25: A landfall ability doesn't trigger if a permanent already on the battlefield becomes a land.
2020/09/25: Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.</Rulings>
