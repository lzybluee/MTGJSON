For example, if you've changed "green" to "blue," and the permanent gains protection from green (as opposed to having protection from green printed on it), that protection ability is unaffected.

<Rulings>2013/04/15: Any time you are instructed to draw more than one card, you draw them one at a time. For example, if you control Blood Scrivener and have no cards in hand and you're instructed to "draw two cards," your first card draw is replaced by drawing two cards and losing 1 life, then you'll draw the second card from the original instruction. In total, you'll draw three cards and lose 1 life.
2013/04/15: Each additional Blood Scrivener you control will effectively add one card and 1 life lost. Say you control two Blood Scriveners and would draw a card while you have no cards in hand. The effect of one Blood Scrivener will replace the event "draw a card" with "draw two cards and lose 1 life." The effect of the other Blood Scrivener will replace the drawing of the first of those two cards with "draw two cards and lose 1 life." You'll draw two cards and lose 1 life, then draw another card and lose another 1 life.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: If Possibility Storm's ability doesn't exile the original spell (perhaps because another Possibility Storm already exiled it), you'll still exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a card that shares a card type with it and have the opportunity to cast that spell.
2013/04/15: If you cast a spell without paying its mana cost, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.

<Artist>Jack Wang</Artist>
<Watermark>Simic</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>368984</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.
2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.</Rulings>

<CardText>Evolve (Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature has greater power or toughness than this creature, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.)

<Multiverseid>369033</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.
2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.
2013/04/15: Renegade Krasis "evolves" when its evolve ability resolves and a +1/+1 counter is put on it. If a replacement effect such as Doubling Season's causes the evolve ability to put more than one +1/+1 counter on Renegade Krasis, its last ability triggers only once. If no +1/+1 counter is put on it (perhaps because it left the battlefield in response to its evolve ability triggering), then its last ability doesn't trigger.
2013/04/15: Renegade Krasis's last ability won't trigger if a +1/+1 counter is put on it for any reason other than its evolve ability resolving.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: If you cast Dragonshift using overload, only creatures you control when it resolves will be affected. Creatures that come under your control later in the turn will not.
2013/04/15: Each affected creature will lose all other colors and creature types and be only red, blue, and a Dragon. Each will retain any other types it may have had, such as artifact.
2013/04/15: Each affected creature will lose any abilities it may have gained prior to Dragonshift resolving. Notably, this includes the ability to cast the copies of a card with cipher that's encoded on the creature, although that ability will return after the turn ends.
2013/04/15: If any of the affected creatures gains an ability after Dragonshift resolves, it will keep that ability.
2013/04/15: Dragonshift overwrites all previous effects that set a creature's power or toughness to specific values. However, effects that set a creature's power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after Dragonshift resolves will overwrite this effect.
2013/04/15: Effects that modify the power or toughness of an affected creature, such as the effects of Phytoburst or Legion's Initiative, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.</Rulings>

It will trigger even if that creature was put onto the battlefield attacking rather than having been declared as an attacker in the declare attackers step.
2013/04/15: Master of Cruelties isn't forced to attack, but if it does, it must do so alone. If you control another creature with an ability that says it must attack if able, that creature must attack and Master of Cruelties won't be able to.
2013/04/15: If Master of Cruelties attacks alone, another creature entering the battlefield attacking will have no effect on it. Master of Cruelties continues to be an attacking creature. The other attacking creature will assign combat damage normally, regardless of whether Master of Cruelties's last ability triggers.
2013/04/15: For a player's life total to become 1, what actually happens is that the player loses (or in some rare cases, gains) the appropriate amount of life.

Other effects that interact with life loss (or gain) will interact with this effect accordingly.

<CardText>Play with the top card of your library revealed.
You may cast instant and sorcery spells from the top of your library.
Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your library, copy it. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Jason Chan</Artist>
<Watermark>Izzet</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>369062</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Melek doesn't affect the timing rules associated with when you can cast the card. If it's a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2013/04/15: You still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs, such as overload costs. Although you can't pay additional costs for the copy that's created, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/04/15: Melek's last ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell you cast from your library, not just one with targets.
2013/04/15: When the last ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2013/04/15: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Debt to the Deathless has), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/04/15: Instant and sorcery cards with miracle allow a player to cast a card immediately upon drawing it. If you cast a spell this way, you're casting it from your hand, not your library. Melek's ability won't trigger.
2013/04/15: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't suspend it, cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2013/04/15: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, the new top card won't be revealed until you finish doing so.
2013/04/15: When playing with the top card of your library revealed, if an effect tells you to draw several cards, reveal each one before you draw it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: If an opponent is instructed to draw a card then discard a card, and Notion Thief causes you to draw a card instead, that opponent still discards a card. The same is true of any other actions that opponent is instructed to do.
2018/03/16: If two or more players each control a Notion Thief and a player would draw a card other than the first one in their draw step, that player chooses one of the applicable Notion Thief effects to apply. Then the player whose Notion Thief's effect was chosen repeats this process among the remaining Notion Thief effects, and so on, until there are no more possible such effects to apply. Each effect can be applied to the card draw only once this way.
2018/03/16: The above procedure means that if each player in a two-player game controls a Notion Thief and one would draw a card, it really will be that player who draws a card.</Rulings>

<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Watermark>Simic</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>369001</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Progenitor Mimic copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2013/04/15: The original Progenitor Mimic will create tokens, but those token copies will not.
2013/04/15: If you choose to have Progenitor Mimic enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature, the triggered ability it gains will become part of its copiable values. For example, suppose Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear, a 2/2 green Bear creature with mana cost {1}{G}. The resulting object is a 2/2 green Bear creature named Runeclaw Bear with mana cost {1}{G} and with "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn't a token, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of this creature." If another Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of that creature, it will be a Runeclaw Bear with two instances of the triggered ability.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature is a token, Progenitor Mimic copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Copying a token doesn't make Progenitor Mimic become a token.
2013/04/15: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2013/04/15: If Progenitor Mimic somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2013/04/15: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: Protection from creatures means that Teysa, Envoy of Ghosts can't be the target of abilities of creatures or abilities of creature cards in other zones, such as bloodrush abilities. Teysa also can't be blocked by creatures, and all damage that would be dealt to Teysa by creatures is prevented.
2013/04/15: Teysa's last ability doesn't target the creature. It will destroy a creature with hexproof or protection from white, for example.
2013/04/15: Teysa's controller gets the Spirit creature token, not the controller of the creature that dealt combat damage.
2013/07/01: You get a Spirit creature token even if Teysa's triggered ability doesn't destroy the creature (perhaps because it regenerated or has indestructible).</Rulings>

2013/04/15: While Varolz, the Scar-Striped is on the battlefield, the scavenge cost of a creature card in your graveyard is equal to its mana cost, including any colored mana requirements.
2013/04/15: Abilities that reduce the cost to cast a creature spell or alternative costs you can pay rather than a card's mana cost don't apply to activating a card's scavenge ability.

<Rulings>2013/04/15: To cast a fused split spell, pay both of its mana costs. While the spell is on the stack, its converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in both costs.
2013/04/15: You can choose the same object as the target of each half of a fused split spell, if appropriate.
2013/04/15: When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets. If all targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. If at least one target is still legal at that time, the spell resolves, but an illegal target can't perform any actions or have any actions performed on it.
2013/04/15: When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half.
2013/04/15: On the stack, a split spell that hasn't been fused has only that half's characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn't exist.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.
2013/04/15: If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.
2013/04/15: Multiple instances of deathtouch or lifelink are redundant.
2013/04/15: If you're casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can't cast both halves. You'll only be able to cast one half or the other.
2013/04/15: A creature that comes under your control after Willing resolves won't have deathtouch or lifelink, because adding abilities does change a creature's characteristics.
2013/07/01: A creature that comes under your control after Ready resolves will not be granted by this effect.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>369038</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Returning Maze's End to its owner's hand is part of the cost to activate its last ability. Once that ability is announced, players can't respond to it until after you've paid its activation cost and returned Maze's End to hand.
2013/04/15: When the last ability of Maze's End resolves, you'll search for a Gate and put it onto the battlefield before checking to see if you win the game. This check will happen even if you don't put a Gate onto the battlefield this way. This check will happen only as the ability resolves, not at other times.
2013/04/15: Putting a Gate onto the battlefield with Maze's End doesn't count as the one land you can play during your turn. If it's your turn, you can play Maze's End or a different land card from your hand after its ability has resolved.
2013/04/15: Controlling multiple Gates with the same name has no effect on your ability to win the game with Maze's End. The excess Gates are simply ignored.</Rulings>
