<Multiverseid>489177</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/06/23: If a player is instructed to put a card into their graveyard without using the word "mill," Bruvac's ability doesn't apply.
2020/06/23: Many cards printed before the Core Set 2021 release have received errata to instruct a player to mill cards rather than to put the top cards of their library into their graveyard. Use the Oracle™ card reference at Gatherer.Wizards.com to determine whether a specific card has received such errata. As a rule of thumb, if an effect instructs a player to look at or reveal a card before it's put into its owner's graveyard, it's unlikely to have received errata.
2020/06/23: Because Bruvac is legendary, it's unlikely that one player will control two. However, if that happens, each opponent mills four times as many cards as originally instructed. If they control three, their opponents mill eight times as many, and so on.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/06/23: Inniaz's ability triggers just once, no matter how many creatures with flying attack beyond the third.

2020/06/23: Inniaz's ability resolves before blockers are chosen.
2020/06/23: You choose the permanents to be blown over to other players while Inniaz's ability is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you make the choices and the time control changes.
2020/06/23: If you give away a creature you control with flying that attacked, it's removed from combat. It will still be tapped if it was tapped, so it won't be able to block.
2020/06/23: In a two-player game, you exchange control of two permanents of your choice with your opponent.
2020/06/23: If any player controls no nonland permanents, the player to their left doesn't gain control of anything.
2020/06/23: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Inniaz's ability ignores who's on which team. The leftmost player on each team gains control of a teammate's permanent, and the rightmost player gains one from the opposing team's leftmost player. If your teammate gains control of an attacking creature this way, it's still removed from combat.
2020/06/23: The control-change effect of Inniaz's last ability lasts indefinitely. It doesn't wear off during the cleanup step, and it doesn't expire if Inniaz leaves the battlefield. In a multiplayer game, a player who leaves the game takes back their permanent and gives back the one they took.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever an opponent draws their first card each turn, if it's not their turn, you create a 1/1 red Devil creature token with "When this creature dies, it deals 1 damage to any target."

<Rulings>2020/06/23: If a spell or ability causes a player to put a card into their hand without specifically using the word "draw," it's not a card drawn.
2020/06/23: If your life total is brought to 0 or less at the same time that a Devil token is dealt lethal damage, you lose the game before its ability goes on the stack.
2020/06/23: Devils you control that attack a planeswalker won't cause any player to draw or discard a card.</Rulings>

<Artist>Randy Vargas</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489195</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/06/23: A spell or ability that counters spells can still target spells that can't be countered. When that spell or ability resolves, the uncounterable spell won't be countered, but any additional effects of the countering spell or ability will still happen.
2020/06/23: Allosaurus Shepherd's last ability overwrites all previous effects that set the affected creatures' power and/or toughness to specific values. Other effects that set these characteristics to specific values that start to apply after the ability resolves will overwrite that part of the effect.
2020/06/23: Effects that modify an affected creature's power or toughness without setting it will apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness.
2020/06/23: The affected creatures don't lose any abilities when they become Dinosaurs.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever one or more creatures you control fight or become blocked, draw a card.
At the beginning of combat on your turn, you may pay {2}{R/G}. If you do, double target creature's power until end of turn. That creature must be blocked this combat if able. ({R/G} can be paid with either {R} or {G}.)</CardText>

<Multiverseid>489197</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/06/23: A creature "fights" when an effect instructs it to fight. Dealing combat damage isn't fighting.
2020/06/23: You draw just one card as Neyith's first ability resolves, no matter how many creatures you control fought or became blocked.
2020/06/23: While resolving Neyith's last ability, you can't pay multiple times to double a creature's power more than once or to double more than one creature's power.
2020/06/23: If an effect instructs you to "double" a creature's power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is its power as that effect begins to apply. If its power is negative, instead it gets -X/-0 where X is how far below 0 its power is. The value of X won't change if another effect alters the creature's power later in the turn.
2020/06/23: Only one creature is required to block the target creature. Other creatures may also block it and are free to block other creatures or not block at all.
2020/06/23: If the target creature has menace, two creatures must block it if able.
2020/06/23: The defending player, not you, chooses which creature blocks the target creature.
2020/06/23: If each creature the defending player controls can't block for any reason (such as being tapped), then the target creature isn't blocked. If there's a cost associated with blocking the target creature, the defending player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to be blocked in that case either.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>489566</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: The ability doesn't trigger until the enchantment enters the battlefield. This means that, for example, you can't cast an Aura with enchant creature if there are no legal targets available, hoping to enchant the Cat token. Ajani's Chosen itself, however, may be a legal target for the Aura.
2013/07/01: If you cast an Aura targeting an opponent or a permanent controlled by an opponent, you control that Aura when it enters the battlefield. The ability of Ajani's Chosen will trigger.
2013/07/01: You may attach the Aura to the token only if it can legally enchant that token. For example, if the enchantment that entered the battlefield is an Aura with "enchant land," it won't move.
2013/07/01: You may attach the Aura to the Cat token only if the Aura and the token are both on the battlefield when the triggered ability resolves. If the Aura leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, it won't become attached to the token. If the token leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, the Aura won't move.</Rulings>

2010/08/15: If Angelic Arbiter leaves the battlefield during an opponent's turn, its abilities cease to affect the game. For example, if an opponent casts Doom Blade to destroy Angelic Arbiter, that player may then attack with creatures.
2010/08/15: If Angelic Arbiter enters the battlefield during an opponent's turn, its abilities take actions that player performed earlier in the turn into account, even though it wasn't on the battlefield at the time. For example, if an opponent casts a spell, then you use Leyline of Anticipation's ability to cast Angelic Arbiter as though it had flash, that player won't be able to attack with creatures that turn.

Enchanted creature gets +3/+3.
Whenever enchanted creature deals combat damage to a player, double its controller's life total.</CardText>
<Flavor>Upon such armor, even a mountain would break.</Flavor>
<Artist>Steve Argyle</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489580</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: At the time the ability triggers, determine which creature Celestial Mantle is enchanting. As the ability resolves, determine who currently controls that creature (or, if it's no longer on the battlefield, determine who controlled it when it left). That's the player whose life total is doubled. It doesn't matter who controls Celestial Mantle, who controlled the creature at the time the ability triggered, or what creature Celestial Mantle enchants at the time the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: If a creature dealing combat damage at the same time as the enchanted creature has lifelink, the life gained due to lifelink happens before Celestial Mantle's triggered ability resolves.
2009/10/01: If the enchanted creature's controller has a life total below 0 (which is possible if that player controls Platinum Angel, for example), Celestial Mantle's triggered ability multiplies that number by two. For example, if the player had -4 life, that player's life total becomes -8.
2009/10/01: If a player's life total is doubled, that player actually gains or loses the necessary amount of life. For example, if the life total of the enchanted creature's controller is 14 when Celestial Mantle's triggered ability resolves, the ability causes that player to gain 14 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Celestial Mantle's essentially doubles the team's life total. Specifically, the triggered ability will affect one player's life total, and then the team's life total is adjusted by the amount of life the player gains as a result of this ability. Suppose a creature enchanted by Celestial Mantle deals combat damage to an opponent, and that creature's controller's team has 11 life. That player then has 11 life, so it's doubled to 22, for a net gain of 11 life. The team's life total becomes 22 (11 + 11).</Rulings>

Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2018/03/16: The returned card won't be the target of any spells or abilities that targeted it before. Any spells that don't target, such as Akroma's Vengeance, will still affect it.
2018/03/16: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.

2017/11/17: If a creature you control is dealt damage at the same time that you gain life (most likely because a source you control with lifelink deals damage at the same time), and your life total becomes greater than or equal to your starting life total, apply Path of Bravery's effect before considering whether or not the damage dealt to that creature is lethal.
2017/11/17: Path of Bravery's triggered ability triggers only once, after attacking creatures are declared. For example, if you attack with five creatures, you'll gain 5 life as a single event.
2017/11/17: If a creature enters the battlefield attacking after attacking creatures have been declared, the ability won't trigger again because you didn't declare that creature as an attacking creature.

2012/07/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, only Rhox Faithmender's controller is affected by it. If that player's teammate gains life, Rhox Faithmender will have no effect, even when that life gain is applied to the shared team life total.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The only difference between a colored artifact and a colorless artifact is, obviously, its color. Unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact requires colored mana to cast. Also unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact has a color in all zones. It will interact with cards that care about color. Other than that, a colored artifact behaves just like any other artifact. It will interact as normal with any card that cares about artifacts, such as Shatter or Arcbound Ravager.
2008/10/01: If combat damage is dealt to players by multiple artifact creatures you control (including, perhaps, Sharding Sphinx itself), Sharding Sphinx's ability will trigger that many times. You'll get that many Thopter tokens. You'll get just one token per creature, no matter how much combat damage that creature dealt.</Rulings>

2018/07/13: Windreader Sphinx's ability will trigger when it itself attacks.
2018/07/13: The creature must have flying immediately after being declared as an attacking creature in order for Windreader Sphinx's ability to trigger. For example, attacking with Kitesail Corsair will cause the ability to trigger, and attacking with Pegasus Courser and a creature without flying will cause the ability to trigger only once.</Rulings>

2016/09/20: An effect that instructs you to "cast" a card doesn't allow you to play lands.
2016/09/20: You pay the costs for the exiled card if you cast it. You may pay alternative costs such as emerge rather than the card's mana cost.
2016/09/20: Gonti doesn't change when you can cast the exiled card. For example, if you exile a creature card without flash, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2016/09/20: Casting the card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
2016/09/20: If you leave the game, the card remains exiled face down indefinitely. No player may look at it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489265</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Nyxathid tracks the hand size of the chosen player even if that player ceases to be an opponent of its controller. (This could happen if that player gains control of Nyxathid, for example.)
2009/02/01: In a multiplayer game, if the chosen player leaves the game, Nyxathid's second ability simply won't do anything anymore.
2009/02/01: Nyxathid's two abilities are linked: The second one refers only to the player chosen by the first one. If another creature becomes a copy of Nyxathid (due to Mirrorweave, for example), the second ability won't do anything because a player was never chosen as a result of the first ability. This is true even if a different ability allowed a player to be chosen as that creature entered the battlefield.
2009/02/01: If a spell or ability causes the chosen player to draw cards and then discard cards, Nyxathid's power and toughness changes accordingly as that spell or ability is resolving. For example, if the chosen player has five cards in hand and a spell causes that player to draw two cards then discard two cards, Nyxathid will start out as 2/2, then become 1/1, 0/0, and finally 2/2. This is because cards are always drawn one at a time, but multiple cards may be discarded at once. Although Nyxathid momentarily had 0 toughness while that spell was resolving, it isn't put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action because state-based actions aren't checked until the spell has finished resolving.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/04/01: If a Rogue would normally enter the battlefield with a certain number of +1/+1 counters on it, it enters the battlefield with that many +1/+1 counters plus one on it instead. If a Rogue would normally enter the battlefield with no +1/+1 counters on it, it enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter on it instead.
2008/04/01: The creature gets the counter if it would enter the battlefield under your control. It doesn't matter who owns the creature or what zone it enters the battlefield from (such as your opponent's graveyard, for example).
2008/04/01: The effects from more than one of these cards are cumulative. That is, if you have two Oona's Blackguard on the battlefield, Rogue creatures you control enter the battlefield with two additional +1/+1 counters on them.
2008/04/01: If Oona's Blackguard enters the battlefield at the same time as another Rogue (due to Living End, for example), that creature doesn't get a +1/+1 counter.</Rulings>

<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489503</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: Dualcaster Mage's triggered ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2016/06/08: As Dualcaster Mage's triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell on the stack. The copy isn't cast, so abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2016/06/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/06/08: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2016/06/08: If the spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/06/08: If the spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2016/06/08: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489504</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: If you cast any of the exiled cards, you do so as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. You can't wait to cast them later in the turn. Timing permissions based on a card's type are ignored, and the spells resolve before blockers are declared.
2021/03/19: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the card.
2021/03/19: If an exiled card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/03/19: If you cast more than one of the exiled cards, you choose the order in which to cast them. A spell you cast this way can be the target of a later spell you cast this way. However, permanent spells cast this way won't resolve until you're done casting spells, so the permanents they become can't be the target of spells cast this way. For example, if you exile Twincast and Lightning Strike, you can cast Lightning Strike and then cast Twincast targeting it; but if you exile a creature card and an Aura card, you can't cast that Aura targeting that creature.
2021/03/19: Any cards not cast, including land cards, remain in exile. They can't be cast on later turns, even if Etali attacks again.
2021/03/19: Because all attacking creatures are chosen at once, a creature cast this way can't attack during the same combat as Etali, even if it has haste.
2021/03/19: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control from Etali's ability are exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: Awakener Druid's ability affects a land with the land type Forest, not necessarily a land with the name Forest.
2009/10/01: Awakener Druid's ability is mandatory. When it enters the battlefield, you must target a Forest (if there is one), even if you don't control that Forest.
2009/10/01: If Awakener Druid leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, nothing happens to the targeted Forest when that ability resolves. It won't become a creature.
2009/10/01: If the targeted Forest entered the battlefield this turn, it will be affected by "summoning sickness" once it becomes a Treefolk. You won't be able to attack with it or use its activated abilities that have {T} in the cost (including its mana ability).
2009/10/01: If Awakener Druid and the Treefolk are dealt lethal damage at the same time, both will be destroyed. However, if Awakener Druid leaves the battlefield before the Treefolk is dealt damage, it will immediately revert to being just a land and thus can't be dealt damage.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: The total cost to cast Ghalta is locked in before you pay that cost. For example, if you control three 2/2 creatures, including one you can sacrifice to add {C} to your mana pool, the total cost of Ghalta is {4}{G}{G}. Then you can sacrifice the creature when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost.
2018/01/19: If a creature's power is somehow less than 0, it subtracts from the total power of your other creatures. If the total power of your creatures is 0 or less, Ghalta's cost remains {10}{G}{G}.

When enchanted land dies, return that card to its owner's hand.</CardText>
<Artist>Rob Alexander</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489423</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The enchanted permanent will be both a land and a creature and can be affected by anything that affects either a land or a creature.
2010/03/01: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/03/01: An attacking or blocking creature that stops being a creature is removed from combat. This can happen if a Zendikon enchanting an attacking or blocking creature leaves the battlefield, for example. The permanent that was removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt combat damage. Any attacking creature that the land creature was blocking remains blocked, however.
2010/03/01: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature, this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness, such as the effects of Disfigure or Glorious Anthem, will continue to apply, no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon and the land it's enchanting are destroyed at the same time (due to Akroma's Vengeance, for example), the Zendikon's last ability will still trigger.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon's last ability triggers, but the land card it refers to leaves the graveyard before it resolves, it will resolve but do nothing.</Rulings>

2018/10/05: If an effect allows you to spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast Chamber Sentry, you consider only the actual mana spent to determine how many counters it receives.
2018/10/05: Colorless mana won't give Chamber Sentry another +1/+1 counter. Colorless is not a color.
2018/10/05: If Chamber Sentry enters the battlefield without being cast, it receives no +1/+1 counters.
2018/10/05: If another creature enters the battlefield as a copy of Chamber Sentry, consider what mana was spent to cast that creature to determine how many +1/+1 counters it enters with.
2018/10/05: The value of X chosen when you activate Chamber Sentry's first activated ability doesn't have to be the same value of X that you chose when you cast it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Felix</Artist>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: The effect of Herald's Horn reduces only generic mana in a spell's cost. If that cost has no generic mana, the cost isn't reduced.
2017/08/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2017/08/25: If you don't put the top card of your library into your hand, you put it back on top of your library without revealing it. You'll draw it in that turn's draw step.
2017/08/25: If you somehow control a Herald's Horn with no chosen creature type, no spells will cost less to cast, not even creature spells with no creature type. You'll be able to look at the top card of your library at the beginning of each of your upkeeps, but you can never put it into your hand this way, even if it's a creature card with no creature type.
2017/08/25: You must choose an existing creature type, such as Vampire or Cat. Card types such as "artifact" can't be chosen.
2017/08/25: You can't choose multiple creature types, such as "Cat Warrior." A Cat Warrior is both a Cat and a Warrior. It's affected by anything that affects either type and unaffected by things that affect non-Cat or non-Warrior creatures.</Rulings>
