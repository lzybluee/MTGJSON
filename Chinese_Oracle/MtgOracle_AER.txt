2017/02/09: If an artifact token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2017/02/09: The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after Consulate Crackdown leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. If Consulate Crackdown exiles multiple artifacts, those cards all return to the battlefield at the same time.
2017/02/09: In a multiplayer game, if Consulate Crackdown's owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

It won't have any additional abilities it may have had when it was exiled. Any +1/+1 counters on it or Auras attached to it are removed, and any Equipment will no longer be attached.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Revolt abilities check only whether a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn or not. They don't apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don't check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.
2017/02/09: Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't permanents. Paying {E} won't satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: All cards in the Aether Revolt set with triggered revolt abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A permanent you controlled must have left the battlefield earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no permanent you controlled has left the battlefield that turn, even if you intend to have one do so in response to the triggered ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/02/09: Effects that allow you to "cast" a card don't allow you to play a land card.
2017/02/09: A card's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
2017/02/09: While you're casting your free spell, the Expertise spell is still on the stack. It will be put into its owner's graveyard after the free spell is cast. The free spell can't target the Expertise card in your graveyard. It can target the Expertise spell on the stack, but the Expertise spell will become an illegal target before the free spell resolves.
2017/02/09: Any triggered abilities that trigger while performing the Expertise spell's first effect won't be put onto the stack until after you're done casting your free spell. They're put onto the stack at the same time as any abilities that triggered while casting that spell regardless of the order in which those abilities triggered.
2017/02/09: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, you must pay those to cast the card.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If an expertise spell allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half or, if that split card has fuse, both halves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: If Thopter Arrest leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
2017/02/09: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2017/02/09: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2017/02/09: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Thopter Arrest leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2017/02/09: In a multiplayer game, if Thopter Arrest's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/02/09: Some triggered abilities state that you "may pay" a certain amount of {E}. You can't pay that amount multiple times to multiply the effect. You simply choose whether or not to pay that amount of {E} as the ability resolves, and no player may take actions to try to stop the ability's effect after you make your choice.</Rulings>

2017/02/09: A card's mana value is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The mana value is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has mana value 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a mana value of 0.
2017/02/09: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

2017/02/09: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs.

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or mana value.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2017/02/09: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Any abilities that trigger on the token being created won't resolve until after Mechanized Production's triggered ability has finished resolving entirely and performed its check for eight artifacts with the same name.
2017/02/09: The eight artifacts with the same name don't have to have the same name as the enchanted artifact. For example, you win the game if you control eight Thopter artifact creature tokens as Mechanized Production's ability resolves, even if Mechanized Production isn't attached to a Thopter.
2017/02/09: All eight of the permanents sharing a name must be artifacts. If you control only seven artifacts with the same name and a nonartifact permanent with that same name, you won't win the game.
2017/02/09: If you control eight or more artifacts that share a name while you control Mechanized Production, you won't win the game yet. You'll win the game while resolving its triggered ability during your upkeep.
2017/02/09: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original artifact and nothing else (unless that artifact is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that artifact is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its types, color, or so on.
2017/02/09: If the copied artifact has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
2017/02/09: If the copied artifact is copying something else (for example, if the copied artifact is a Sculpting Steel), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that artifact copied.
2017/02/09: If the copied artifact is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
2017/02/09: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied artifact trigger when the artifact token enters the battlefield. The artifact token also has any "this enters the battlefield with" or "as this enters the battlefield" abilities that the copied artifact has.
2017/02/09: If Mechanized Production and the enchanted artifact leave the battlefield simultaneously in response to the triggered ability, then the effect creates a token that's a copy of the artifact as it last existed on the battlefield.
2017/02/09: If the enchanted artifact leaves the battlefield in response to Mechanized Production's triggered ability but Mechanized Production does not, Mechanized Production is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action with no enchanted artifact. The triggered ability creates no token, but you can still win the game if you control enough artifacts with the same name.</Rulings>

2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/02/09: Some triggered abilities state that you "may pay" a certain amount of {E}. You can't pay that amount multiple times to multiply the effect. You simply choose whether or not to pay that amount of {E} as the ability resolves, and no player may take actions to try to stop the ability's effect after you make your choice.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or mana value.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2017/02/09: If the target creature becomes an illegal target, Battle at the Bridge doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. You won't gain life.
2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2017/02/09: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.
2017/02/09: When using improvise to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Whir of Invention (a spell with improvise and mana cost {X}{U}{U}{U}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{U}{U}{U}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{U}{U}{U}.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards.

<Rulings>2017/02/09: When Perilous Predicament resolves, first the player whose turn it is (if that player is an opponent) chooses which creatures they will sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, then all chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
2017/02/09: If each creature an opponent controls is an artifact creature, that player sacrifices only one creature. Similarly, if each creature an opponent controls is a nonartifact creature, that player sacrifices only one creature. If an opponent controls no creatures, that player doesn't sacrifice anything.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: If Sly Requisitioner is put into a graveyard at the same time as a nontoken artifact you control, its ability triggers.
2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2017/02/09: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>423740</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: Revolt abilities check only whether a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn or not. They don't apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don't check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.
2017/02/09: Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't permanents. Paying {E} won't satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: All cards in the Aether Revolt set with triggered revolt abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A permanent you controlled must have left the battlefield earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no permanent you controlled has left the battlefield that turn, even if you intend to have one do so in response to the triggered ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: A card's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
2017/02/09: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/02/09: Effects that allow you to "cast" a card don't allow you to play a land card.
2017/02/09: If a creature's toughness is reduced to 0 or less by Yahenni's Expertise, that creature is still on the battlefield as you cast your free spell. It can be the target of that spell, although it will become an illegal target before that spell resolves. If it has any abilities that trigger on the spell being cast, those abilities will trigger.
2017/02/09: While you're casting your free spell, the Expertise spell is still on the stack. It will be put into its owner's graveyard after the free spell is cast. The free spell can't target the Expertise card in your graveyard. It can target the Expertise spell on the stack, but the Expertise spell will become an illegal target before the free spell resolves.
2017/02/09: Any triggered abilities that trigger while performing the Expertise spell's first effect won't be put onto the stack until after you're done casting your free spell. They're put onto the stack at the same time as any abilities that triggered while casting that spell regardless of the order in which those abilities triggered.
2017/02/09: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, you must pay those to cast the card.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If an expertise spell allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half or, if that split card has fuse, both halves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/02/09: Some triggered abilities state that you "may pay" a certain amount of {E}. You can't pay that amount multiple times to multiply the effect. You simply choose whether or not to pay that amount of {E} as the ability resolves, and no player may take actions to try to stop the ability's effect after you make your choice.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: If the Expertise spell you cast has any targets, and those targets become illegal before the spell resolves, the spell doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. You won't get to cast a free spell.
2017/02/09: A card's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
2017/02/09: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/02/09: Kari Zev's Expertise can target any creature or Vehicle, even one that you already control or that is already untapped.
2017/02/09: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, you must pay those to cast the card.
2017/02/09: While you're casting your free spell, the Expertise spell is still on the stack. It will be put into its owner's graveyard after the free spell is cast. The free spell can't target the Expertise card in your graveyard. It can target the Expertise spell on the stack, but the Expertise spell will become an illegal target before the free spell resolves.
2017/02/09: Any triggered abilities that trigger while performing the Expertise spell's first effect won't be put onto the stack until after you're done casting your free spell. They're put onto the stack at the same time as any abilities that triggered while casting that spell regardless of the order in which those abilities triggered.
2017/02/09: Effects that allow you to "cast" a card don't allow you to play a land card.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If an expertise spell allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half or, if that split card has fuse, both halves.</Rulings>

2017/02/09: The target opponent chooses whether to have Pia's Revolution deal 3 damage to them as its ability resolves. You won't return the card to your hand if that player chooses to be dealt damage or if the card leaves the graveyard before the ability resolves.
2017/02/09: If there are no legal targets for Pia's Revolution's ability (perhaps because each of your opponents has hexproof), it will be removed from the stack with no effect. No one may choose to be dealt damage and you won't return the artifact card to your hand.

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.

2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.

<Rulings>2017/02/09: The triggered ability triggers both when Aetherwind Basker enters the battlefield and whenever it attacks. You don't have to choose only one.
2017/02/09: Abilities that trigger "whenever you get one or more {E}," such as that of Fabrication Module from the Kaladesh set, trigger only once as Aetherwind Basker's triggered ability resolves.
2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: If the revealed card is not a permanent card or if you choose not to put it onto the battlefield, you may put it on the bottom of your library. If you don't, it remains on top of your library.
2017/02/09: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2017/02/09: If a permanent put onto the battlefield this way has an ability that triggers at the beginning of your end step, it won't trigger during this end step.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities check only whether a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn or not. They don't apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don't check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.
2017/02/09: Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't permanents. Paying {E} won't satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: All cards in the Aether Revolt set with triggered revolt abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A permanent you controlled must have left the battlefield earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no permanent you controlled has left the battlefield that turn, even if you intend to have one do so in response to the triggered ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: If you control no creatures with power greater than 0 as Rishkar's Expertise resolves, you draw no cards, but you may cast a card with mana value 5 or less from your hand without paying its mana cost.
2017/02/09: You may cast one of the cards drawn by Rishkar's Expertise's first effect while performing its second effect.
2017/02/09: A card's mana value is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The mana value is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has mana value 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a mana value of 0.
2017/02/09: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/02/09: The greatest power among creatures you control is determined as Rishkar's Expertise resolves.
2017/02/09: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, you must pay those to cast the card.
2017/02/09: While you're casting your free spell, the Expertise spell is still on the stack. It will be put into its owner's graveyard after the free spell is cast. The free spell can't target the Expertise card in your graveyard. It can target the Expertise spell on the stack, but the Expertise spell will become an illegal target before the free spell resolves.
2017/02/09: Any triggered abilities that trigger while performing the Expertise spell's first effect won't be put onto the stack until after you're done casting your free spell. They're put onto the stack at the same time as any abilities that triggered while casting that spell regardless of the order in which those abilities triggered.
2017/02/09: Effects that allow you to "cast" a card don't allow you to play a land card.
2017/04/18: The mana value of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If an expertise spell allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half or, if that split card has fuse, both halves.</Rulings>

You still draw a card even if you can't return a card to your hand.
2017/02/09: When Dark Intimations resolves, first the player whose turn it is (if that player is an opponent) chooses which creature or planeswalker they will sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, then all chosen permanents are sacrificed at the same time. Then each opponent in the same order chooses a card in their hand without revealing it, then all chosen cards are discarded at the same time.
2017/02/09: If two or more Dark Intimations are in your graveyard when you cast a Bolas planeswalker spell, you'll exile each of them and that planeswalker will enter the battlefield with that many additional loyalty counters.
2017/02/09: The draconic Planeswalker Nicol Bolas is not featured in the Aether Revolt set. He must be up to something nefarious elsewhere.

2018/07/13: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2018/07/13: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2018/07/13: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2018/07/13: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.
2018/07/13: When using improvise to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Saheeli's Directive and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{R}{R}{R}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{R}{R}{R}.</Rulings>

<Artist>Christine Choi</Artist>
<Multiverseid>423809</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature are redundant.
2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.
2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>423811</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: If, during your declare attackers step, Barricade Breaker is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or mana value.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2017/02/09: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original artifact and nothing else (unless that artifact is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that artifact is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/02/09: If the copied artifact has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/02/09: If the copied artifact is copying something else (for example, if the copied artifact is a Sculpting Steel), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that artifact copied.
2017/02/09: If the copied artifact is a token, the token created with Cogwork Assembler copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that that created that token.

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Paying Heart of Kiran's alternative crew cost isn't a loyalty ability. It can be done even if you've already activated a loyalty ability of the planeswalker this turn, and it can be done any time you could activate Heart of Kiran's crew ability.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.
2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2017/02/09: Multiple instances of improvise are redundant.
2017/02/09: If you cast a nonartifact spell that requires you to sacrifice a permanent as an additional cost, you may tap that permanent (if it's an artifact) for the spell's improvise ability before you sacrifice it to pay that cost.
2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2017/02/09: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.
2017/02/09: When using improvise to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Whir of Invention (a spell with improvise and mana cost {X}{U}{U}{U}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{U}{U}{U}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{U}{U}{U}.</Rulings>
