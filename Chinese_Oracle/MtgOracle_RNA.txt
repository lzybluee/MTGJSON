When Angel of Grace enters the battlefield, until end of turn, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.
{4}{W}{W}, Exile Angel of Grace from your graveyard: Your life total becomes 10.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Yee</Artist>
<Multiverseid>457145</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/01/25: Angel of Grace's triggered ability doesn't prevent damage. It only changes the result of damage dealt to you. For example, a creature with lifelink that deals damage to you will still cause its controller to gain life, even if that damage would reduce your life total to less than 1.
2019/01/25: Angel of Grace's triggered ability doesn't stop loss of life from effects that say that you lose life.
2019/01/25: If you have less than 1 life and somehow haven't lost the game, damage dealt to you reduces your life total further below 0 (as normal).
2019/01/25: For a player's life total to become 10, that player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if your life total is 2, Angel of Grace's last ability will cause you to gain 8 life; alternatively, if your life total is 20, it will cause you to lose 10 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2019/01/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, after resolving Angel of Grace's triggered ability, damage dealt to you and/or your teammate that would reduce your team's life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.
2019/01/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, the activated ability of Angel of Grace causes you to gain or lose life so that your team's life total becomes 10.
2019/01/25: In a Commander game, combat damage you're dealt by a commander is still tracked, even if it doesn't change your life total.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/01/25: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by Tithe Taker.
2019/01/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases (such as that of Tithe Taker's effect), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/01/25: An opponent's activated ability that costs no mana to activate will cost {1} plus its non-mana costs during your turn.

<Rulings>2019/01/25: A creature with power 0 or less can attack, as long as no rule or effect prohibits it from doing so. Many creatures with 0 power have defender, but not all do.
2019/01/25: The power of the attacking creature is checked only when the ability triggers. Once it triggers, Cavalcade of Calamity will deal 1 damage to the appropriate player or planeswalker even if the creature's power changes or the creature leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves.
2019/01/25: If multiple creatures you control with power 1 or less attack, Cavalcade of Calamity's ability will trigger for each of those creatures. Each ability will cause Cavalcade of Calamity to deal 1 damage to the appropriate player or planeswalker.</Rulings>

If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.

2019/01/25: Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.
2019/01/25: Spectacle doesn't change when you can cast the card. For example, you can't cast a sorcery with spectacle during an opponent's turn unless another effect allows you to do so, even if that player has lost life this turn.
2019/01/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as a spectacle cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/01/25: A card's spectacle cost is the same no matter how much life your opponents lost or how many opponents lost life.

<Rulings>2019/01/25: Once Captive Audience is controlled by your opponent, its ability triggers during that player's upkeep and that player makes all choices for it. That player is affected by its first two modes, and that player's opponents create the tokens for its last mode.
2019/01/25: For a player's life total to become 4, that player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if a player's life total is 20, Captive Audience will cause that player to lose 16 life; alternatively, if their life total is 1, it will cause them to gain 3 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.

2019/01/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Captive Audience's first mode causes its controller to gain or lose life so that their team's life total becomes 4.

Multiple instances of haste on the same creature are redundant, but we're not going to tell the Gruul how to live their lives.
2019/01/25: Riot is a replacement effect. Players can't respond to your choice of +1/+1 counter or haste, and they can't take actions while the creature is on the battlefield without one or the other.
2019/05/03: If Rhythm of the Wild leaves the battlefield at the same time that a nontoken creature enters the battlefield (most likely because that creature has a replacement effect, such as that of Rescuer Sphinx), that creature still gets a +1/+1 counter or haste.</Rulings>

<Watermark>Orzhov</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>457356</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/01/25: Teysa affects a creature's own "when this creature dies" triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that creature dies. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
2019/01/25: Teysa's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to pay a cost for that triggered ability, are also made separately.
2019/01/25: The trigger event doesn't have to specifically refer to "creatures." In these cases, the trigger event may also refer to something being "put into a graveyard from the battlefield." For example, an ability that triggers "whenever an artifact is put into a graveyard from the battlefield" would trigger twice if an artifact creature dies while Teysa Karlov is on the battlefield.
2019/01/25: An ability that triggers when a creature "leaves the battlefield" will trigger twice if that creature leaves the battlefield by dying.
2019/01/25: An ability that triggers on an event that causes a creature to die doesn't trigger twice. For example, an ability that triggers "whenever you sacrifice a creature" triggers only once.
2019/01/25: Look at each creature as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger multiple times. For example, if a land that has become a creature dies, an ability that triggers when it dies triggers twice.
2019/01/25: If a creature dying at the same time that another permanent you control leaves the battlefield causes a triggered ability of that permanent to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2019/01/25: If a creature dying at the same time as Teysa (including Teysa itself dying) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2019/01/25: If you somehow control two Teysas, a creature dying causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Teysa causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on. This also means that if you control Teysa and cast a second one, an ability that triggers when it dies due to the "legend rule" triggers three times.
2019/01/25: An ability of a permanent that triggers when a card is put into a graveyard "from anywhere" triggers twice only if Teysa and that permanent are both still on the battlefield immediately after the creature has died.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/01/25: Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as equip, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
2019/01/25: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as afterlife, are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
2019/01/25: An activated mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool as it resolves, doesn't have a target, and isn't a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool and triggers on an activated mana ability.
2019/01/25: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can't be targeted. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and can't be targeted.
2019/01/25: If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggered at the beginning of the "next" occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won't trigger again the following time that phase or step occurs.

It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2019/01/25: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2019/01/25: If the copied creature is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.
2019/01/25: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Mirror Image), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
