<CardText>Hidden agenda (Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly choose a card name. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal that name.)
Whenever a creature you control with the chosen name attacks, you may pay {W}. If you do, that creature gains indestructible until end of turn. (Damage and effects that say "destroy" don't destroy it.)</CardText>

<Rulings>2016/08/23: The last ability triggers once for each creature with the chosen name that attacks. You choose whether to pay {W} as the ability resolves. Notably, someone could respond to the ability and destroy the creature before it gains indestructible.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are never put into your deck. Instead, you put any number of conspiracies from your card pool into the command zone as the game begins. These conspiracies are face up unless they have hidden agenda, in which case they begin the game face down.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy doesn't count as a card in your deck for purposes of meeting minimum deck size requirements. (In most drafts, the minimum deck size is 40 cards.)
2016/08/23: You don't have to play with any conspiracy you draft. However, you have only one opportunity to put conspiracies into the command zone, as the game begins. You can't put conspiracies into the command zone after this point.
2016/08/23: You can look at any player's face-up conspiracies at any time. You'll also know how many face-down conspiracies a player has in the command zone, although you won't know what they are.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy's static and triggered abilities function as long as that conspiracy is face-up in the command zone.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are colorless, have no mana cost, and can't be cast as spells.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies aren't legal for any sanctioned Constructed format, but may be included in other Limited formats, such as Cube Draft.
2016/08/23: You name the card as the game begins, as you put the conspiracy into the command zone, not as you turn the face-down conspiracy face up.
2016/08/23: There are several ways to secretly name a card, including writing the name on a piece of paper that's kept with the face-down conspiracy. If you have multiple face-down conspiracies, you may name a different card for each one. It's important that each named card is clearly associated with only one of the conspiracies.
2016/08/23: You must name a Magic card. Notably, you can't name a token (except in the unusual case that a token's name matches the name of a card, such as Illusion).
2016/08/23: If you play multiple games after the draft, you can name a different card in each new game.
2016/08/23: As a special action, you may turn a face-down conspiracy face up. You may do so any time you have priority. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Once face up, the named card is revealed and the conspiracy's abilities will affect the game.
2016/08/23: At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy with hidden agenda that has a triggered ability must be face up before that ability's trigger condition is met in order for it to trigger. Turning it face up afterward won't have any effect.
2016/08/23: At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players. Notably, you can't bluff conspiracies with hidden agenda by putting other cards into the command zone face down as the game starts.</Rulings>

2016/08/23: At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are colorless, have no mana cost, and can't be cast as spells.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy with hidden agenda that has a triggered ability must be face up before that ability's trigger condition is met in order for it to trigger. Turning it face up afterward won't have any effect.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies aren't legal for any sanctioned Constructed format, but may be included in other Limited formats, such as Cube Draft.
2016/08/23: The instant or sorcery spell can target other things as well, as long as one of its targets is a creature you control with the chosen name.
2016/08/23: When Echoing Boon's ability resolves, it creates a copy of the instant or sorcery spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, before the original spell resolves but after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2016/08/23: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If you can't choose a new legal target for one of the targets, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/08/23: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/08/23: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Subterranean Tremors has), the copy will have the same value of X.
2016/08/23: If the spell being copied has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2016/08/23: If an alternative cost was paid for the spell being copied, such as a madness cost or surge cost, the same alternative cost is considered to have been paid for the copy.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are never put into your deck. Instead, you put any number of conspiracies from your card pool into the command zone as the game begins. These conspiracies are face up unless they have hidden agenda, in which case they begin the game face down.

<Rulings>2016/08/23: Even though your starting hand size is five, nothing else about the pregame procedure changes.
2016/08/23: Unless an effect states otherwise, you are still limited to one land play on each of your turns. Activating the ability of Sovereign's Realm multiple times on your turn has no additional benefit.
2016/08/23: In Limited and Constructed events, "outside the game" means your sideboard. In Limited events, your sideboard is considered to have as many cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest as needed. You don't have to draft such cards.
2016/08/23: If you're drafting with other sets and draft basic land cards other than the five mentioned above (including Wastes and the "Snow-Covered" versions of the typical basic lands), those cards will be in your sideboard and the activated ability of Sovereign's Realm will allow you to play them. Also, invite me to your next draft—your group sounds rad.
2016/08/23: The ability of Sovereign's Realm doesn't change when you can play lands. You can still only play them during your main phase, if the stack is empty, if you have priority, and if you have an available land play.

<Rulings>2016/08/23: The value of X in the last ability is calculated in a similar fashion to how melee bonuses are calculated. It doesn't matter if the creatures are still attacking or on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the player you attacked is still in the game.
2016/08/23: You determine the size of the bonus as the melee ability resolves. Count each opponent that you attacked with one or more creatures. It doesn't matter if the attacking creatures are still attacking or even if they are still on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the opponent you attacked is still in the game.
2016/08/23: It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked a player with, only that you attacked a player with at least one creature. For example, if you attack one player with Wings of the Guard and another player with five creatures, Wings of the Guard will get +2/+2 until end of turn.
2016/08/23: Melee will trigger if the creature with melee attacks a planeswalker. However, the effect counts only opponents (and not planeswalkers) that you attacked with a creature when determining the bonus.
2016/08/23: Creatures that enter the battlefield attacking were never declared as attackers, so they won't count toward melee's effect. Similarly, if a creature with melee enters the battlefield attacking, melee won't trigger.</Rulings>

2016/08/23: Because the votes are made in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.

2016/08/23: Abilities that trigger whenever you "become the monarch" trigger only if you aren't already the monarch. For example, if you are already the monarch as Custodi Lich enters the battlefield, its last ability won't trigger.
2016/08/23: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack, and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.</Rulings>

It doesn't matter if the attacking creatures are still attacking or even if they are still on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the opponent you attacked is still in the game.
2016/08/23: It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked a player with, only that you attacked a player with at least one creature. For example, if you attack one player with Wings of the Guard and another player with five creatures, Wings of the Guard will get +2/+2 until end of turn.
2016/08/23: Melee will trigger if the creature with melee attacks a planeswalker. However, the effect counts only opponents (and not planeswalkers) that you attacked with a creature when determining the bonus.
2016/08/23: Creatures that enter the battlefield attacking were never declared as attackers, so they won't count toward melee's effect. Similarly, if a creature with melee enters the battlefield attacking, melee won't trigger.</Rulings>

If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack a player, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2016/08/23: If the creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than the controller of the spell or ability that goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or the player that goaded it.
2016/08/23: Being goaded isn't an ability the creature has. Once it's been goaded, it must attack as detailed above even if it loses all abilities.
2016/08/23: Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded. If there is an additional combat phase that turn, or if another player gains control of it before it stops being goaded, it must attack again if able.

<Rulings>2016/08/23: Once Archdemon of Paliano is turned face down, you may look at booster packs and draft cards as normal.
2016/08/23: After you draft a card at random, look at it to determine whether it needs to be revealed as it's drafted or drafted face up. If it does, follow its instructions as normal.
2016/08/23: If you have more than one face-up Archdemon of Paliano, keep track of the number of cards you've drafted at random for each one. Each card you draft at random counts toward the demands of all your Archdemons. While you're doing this, consider carefully why the Archdemon seems to favor you.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/08/23: Each opponent chooses an appropriate number of creatures to sacrifice in turn order, then all of those creatures are sacrificed simultaneously. After that is complete, each opponent sets aside an appropriate number of cards to discard in turn order, then all cards are revealed and discarded simultaneously.
2016/08/23: If an opponent controls fewer creatures or has fewer cards in hand than the number of appropriate votes, all those creatures are sacrificed or all those cards are discarded, as applicable.
2016/08/23: Unlike the will of the council cards from the original Conspiracy set, where a majority of votes determined what happened, each vote made for a council's dilemma card adds to the ultimate effect.
2016/08/23: The effects of each council's dilemma ability happen in the stated order. First the vote occurs, then the first effect, and finally the second effect.
2016/08/23: Because the votes are made in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.
2016/08/23: You must vote for one of the available options. You can't abstain.
2016/08/23: If a creature with an enters-the-battlefield council's dilemma ability leaves the battlefield before that ability resolves, players can still vote for any option that would put +1/+1 counters on that creature, even though—or perhaps especially because—those votes won't generate an effect.
2016/08/23: No player votes until the spell or ability resolves. Any responses to that spell or ability must be made without knowing the outcome of the vote.
2016/08/23: Players can't do anything between voting and finishing the resolution of the spell or ability that included the vote.</Rulings>

2016/08/23: Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded. If there is an additional combat phase that turn, or if another player gains control of it before it stops being goaded, it must attack again if able.
2016/08/23: If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents that hasn't goaded it, as that fulfills the maximum number of goad requirements. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/08/23: You determine the size of the bonus as the melee ability resolves. Count each opponent that you attacked with one or more creatures. It doesn't matter if the attacking creatures are still attacking or even if they are still on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the opponent you attacked is still in the game.
2016/08/23: It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked a player with, only that you attacked a player with at least one creature. For example, if you attack one player with Wings of the Guard and another player with five creatures, Wings of the Guard will get +2/+2 until end of turn.
2016/08/23: Melee will trigger if the creature with melee attacks a planeswalker. However, the effect counts only opponents (and not planeswalkers) that you attacked with a creature when determining the bonus.
2016/08/23: Creatures that enter the battlefield attacking were never declared as attackers, so they won't count toward melee's effect. Similarly, if a creature with melee enters the battlefield attacking, melee won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: Your opponents can draw a maximum of one card each on each player's turn. Subsequent card draws during that turn are ignored.
2018/12/07: If an opponent hasn't drawn any cards in a turn and a spell or ability instructs that player to draw multiple cards, that player will just draw one card. However, if the draws are optional, the player can't choose to draw, even if they could draw one card this way.
2018/12/07: Leovold will "see" cards drawn by opponents earlier in the turn before it entered the battlefield, although Leovold can't affect cards drawn before it entered the battlefield. For example, if an opponent draws two cards, then Leovold enters the battlefield, that opponent can't draw more cards that turn, but the two drawn cards are unaffected.
2018/12/07: Replacement effects (such as that of dredge or Laboratory Maniac's ability) can't be used to replace draws that Leovold disallows. However, if an opponent's first draw is replaced (by a dredge ability, for example), that draw didn't happen and Leovold won't stop the next draw.
2018/12/07: If you and a permanent you control each become the target of the same spell or ability an opponent controls, Leovold's ability will trigger twice. The same is true if two permanents you control become the target of the same spell or ability an opponent controls.</Rulings>

If no opponent is the monarch, Queen Marchesa's (long may she reign) ability won't trigger at all. Queen Marchesa's (long may she reign) ability will also check to see if an opponent is the monarch as it tries to resolve. If no opponent is the monarch at that time, Queen Marchesa's (long may she reign) ability will have no effect.
2016/08/23: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward.
2016/08/23: Being the monarch carries two inherent triggered abilities. "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."
2016/08/23: Abilities that trigger whenever you "become the monarch" trigger only if you aren't already the monarch. For example, if you are already the monarch as Custodi Lich enters the battlefield, its last ability won't trigger.

<Rulings>2016/08/23: The set of names the equipped creature has includes the names of all nonlegendary creature cards in the Oracle card reference, including the back faces of double-faced cards. Notably, the equipped creature won't gain the names of tokens, such as Zombie, Goblin, and similar. It also won't gain the names of noncreature cards that have become creatures, such as a Wandering Fumarole that has become a creature.
2016/08/23: If you named any nonlegendary creature card for hidden agenda or draft abilities that refer to a creature on the battlefield, the equipped creature will have that name and will qualify for any relevant bonuses. For example, equipping Spy Kit to Noble Banneret will enable Noble Banneret's last ability (as long as you noted a nonlegendary card name for it).
2016/08/23: Some creature cards have abilities that function during the draft and additional abilities that refer to cards you exiled or information you noted with "cards named [this card's name]." These abilities are linked, so equipping Spy Kit to such a creature won't affect the set of cards it exiled or the information you noted.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/07/01: A permanent card is a card that could be put onto the battlefield. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card (instant and sorcery cards aren't permanent cards).
2012/07/01: Permanent cards that were put into your graveyard from anywhere else, such as a card that was discarded, stay in the graveyard. Permanent cards that you gained control of and went to another player's graveyard from the battlefield will likewise stay in the graveyard.

<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, basic landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a basic land card.

After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.

<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, basic landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a basic land card. You don't choose the type of basic land card you'll find until you're performing the search. After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose not to find a basic land card, even if there is one in your library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game, or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.
2009/10/01: Even though Trumpet Blast affects only attacking creatures, the bonus will remain for the rest of the turn.
2014/09/20: Only creatures that are attacking as Trumpet Blast resolves will receive the bonus. In other words, casting it before you've declared attackers usually won't do anything.</Rulings>

After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.

<CardText>Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, if you cast it from your hand, you may search your library for a creature card with the same total power and toughness, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle.</CardText>
<Artist>Lars Grant-West</Artist>
<Multiverseid>416953</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: If you cast a 2/2 Grizzly Bears, for example, you may then search for any creature with total power and toughness 4. It can be 0/4, 1/3, 2/2, or 3/1.
2007/02/01: The game checks the power and toughness of the creature that just entered the battlefield as it exists on the battlefield. That might mean it's impossible to get another copy of that same card. For example, a Triskelion on the battlefield is 4/4, but a Triskelion in your library is 1/1. The power and toughness might also have been affected while the triggered ability was on the stack (such as with Giant Growth, Sudden Death, or Ovinize).
2007/02/01: If the creature that entered the battlefield has left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, use the power and toughness of that creature as it last appeared before leaving the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. Exotic Orchard can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/02/01: Exotic Orchard checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control Exotic Orchard, you can tap Exotic Orchard for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/02/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, Exotic Orchard takes into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there are more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/02/01: Exotic Orchard doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.
2009/02/01: Lands that produce mana based only on what other lands "could produce" won't help each other unless some other land allows one of them to actually produce some type of mana. For example, if you control an Exotic Orchard and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard and a Reflecting Pool, none of those lands would produce mana if their mana abilities were activated. On the other hand, if you control a Forest and an Exotic Orchard, and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard and a Reflecting Pool, then each of those lands can be tapped to produce {G}. Your opponent's Exotic Orchard can produce {G} because you control a Forest. Your Exotic Orchard and your opponent's Reflecting Pool can each produce {G} because your opponent's Exotic Orchard can produce {G}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/08/23: You choose whether or not to target a creature as you activate the first ability. If you chose a target creature, you choose whether to exile Kaya or that creature as the ability resolves. If you chose a creature and that creature is no longer a legal target as the ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. You won't exile Kaya or lose 2 life.
2016/08/23: If you didn't choose a target creature for the first ability, and Kaya isn't on the battlefield as the ability resolves, you'll just lose 2 life. No card will be exiled or returned to the battlefield.
2016/08/23: As the last ability resolves, each opponent will choose a card to discard and set it aside. Then all those cards are revealed and discarded simultaneously.</Rulings>
