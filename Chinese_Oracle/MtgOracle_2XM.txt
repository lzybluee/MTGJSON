<Rulings>2020/08/07: A game that restarts immediately ends the preceding game. The players in that game then immediately begin a new game. No player wins, loses, or draws the original game as a result of Karn's ability.
2020/08/07: Players can't move cards between their deck and sideboard before the new game.
2020/08/07: The player who controlled the ability that restarted the game is the starting player in the new game. The new game starts like a game normally does: Each player shuffles their deck (except the cards left in exile by Karn's ability). Each player's life total becomes 20 (or the starting life total for whatever format you're playing). Players draw a hand of seven cards. Players may take mulligans. Players may take actions based on cards in their opening hands, such as those of Leylines.
2020/08/07: Karn's first and third abilities are linked. Similarly, Karn's second and third abilities are linked. Only non-Aura permanent cards exiled by either of Karn's first two abilities will remain in exile when the game restarts.
2020/08/07: After the pregame procedure is complete but before the new game's first turn, Karn's ability finishes resolving and the cards left in exile are put onto the battlefield. If this causes any triggered abilities to trigger, those abilities are put onto the stack at the beginning of the first upkeep step.
2020/08/07: Permanents put onto the battlefield due to Karn's ability will have been under the starting controller's control continuously since the beginning of that player's first turn. Creatures among them can attack and their activated abilities with {T} in the cost can be activated.
2020/08/07: Any permanents put onto the battlefield with Karn's ability that entered the battlefield tapped will untap during their controller's first untap step.
2020/08/07: No actions taken in the game that was restarted apply to the new game. For example, if you were dealt damage by Stigma Lasher in the original game, the effect that states you can't gain life doesn't carry over to the new game.
2020/08/07: Players won't have any counters or emblems they had in the original game.
2020/08/07: In a multiplayer game, any player who left the game before it was restarted with Karn's ability won't be involved in the new game.
2020/08/07: If a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, the permanents you control from Karn's ability are exiled.
2020/08/07: In a Commander game, each player puts their commander into the command zone before shuffling their deck, unless it was exiled with Karn. In that case, the commander remains in exile and will be put onto the battlefield when Karn's ability finishes resolving.
2020/08/07: The number of times a player has cast their commander from the command zone resets to zero. The amount of combat damage dealt to players by each commander is reset to 0.</Rulings>

<Artist>Scott Murphy</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489676</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: The Soldier token that you create enters the battlefield as a 1/1 creature. Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield will see the token enter as a 1/1 creature. Static abilities that affect the Soldier's power and toughness may change this, but Ancestral Blade will be attached to the Soldier before the game checks to see if it has toughness 0 or less. For example, if Illness in the Ranks ("Creature tokens get -1/-1") is on the battlefield, the Soldier will enter as a 0/0 creature, but then Ancestral Blade will make it a 1/1 and the token will survive.
2020/11/10: No player may take any actions between the time you create the Soldier token and the time Ancestral Blade becomes attached to it.
2020/11/10: If the triggered ability causes two Soldiers to be created (due to an effect such as that of Doubling Season), Ancestral Blade becomes attached to one of them.</Rulings>

2020/08/07: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, the ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2020/08/07: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability triggers only once.
2020/08/07: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: If the first and last modes are chosen, an artifact creature with mana value 4 or greater will have to be regenerated twice to survive.

2020/08/07: If an effect would set your life total to a specific number that's higher than your current life total, that effect would cause you to gain life equal to the difference. Boon Reflection will then double the amount of life that effect would cause you to gain. For example, if you have 3 life and an effect says that your life total "becomes 10," your life total will actually become 17.

<Rulings>2020/08/07: If an Aura is put onto the battlefield without being cast, the Aura's controller-to-be chooses what it will enchant as it enters the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to an opponent's permanent with hexproof, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains in its current zone.

2020/08/07: If multiple players have Auras in their graveyards, the player whose turn it is announces what their Auras will enchant, then each other player in turn order does the same, then all artifacts and enchantments (including both Auras and non-Auras) enter the battlefield at the same time.

<Rulings>2020/08/07: If you don't pay the overload cost of Cyclonic Rift, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2020/08/07: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2020/08/07: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an overload cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2020/08/07: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/08/07: If the affected creature gains an ability after Frogify becomes attached to it, it will keep that ability.
2020/08/07: Frogify overwrites all colors and creature types the enchanted creature has. It's just a blue Frog. The creature keeps any supertypes (such as legendary) it has, but loses any other card types it has (such as artifact).
2020/08/07: Frogify overwrites all previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Frogify becomes attached to a creature will overwrite this effect.
2020/08/07: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Dead Weight, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness.
2020/08/07: Frogify may enchant a permanent that is only temporarily a creature, such as a Vehicle. If this happens, Frogify's effect causes the enchanted permanent to remain a 1/1 blue Frog creature even after the temporary effect expires.
2020/08/07: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a creature may become lethal if Frogify becomes attached to it during that turn.</Rulings>

You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.

<Rulings>2011/06/01: A card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in that mana cost, regardless of how that cost may have been paid.
2011/06/01: To calculate the mana value of a card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, count each Phyrexian mana symbol as 1.
2011/06/01: As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with one or more Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, you choose how to pay for each Phyrexian mana symbol at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for X.
2011/06/01: If you're at 1 life or less, you can't pay 2 life.
2011/06/01: Phyrexian mana is not a new color. Players can't add Phyrexian mana to their mana pools.
2011/06/01: Except for also being an artifact, Phyrexian Metamorph copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent and nothing more (unless that creature is itself copying something or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2011/06/01: If Phyrexian Metamorph copies a noncreature artifact, it is no longer a creature.
2011/06/01: If the chosen permanent has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2011/06/01: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is a Clone), then your Phyrexian Metamorph enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied, except it's also an artifact.
2011/06/01: If the chosen permanent is a token, Phyrexian Metamorph copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield, except it's also an artifact. Phyrexian Metamorph is not a token.
2011/06/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when Phyrexian Metamorph enters the battlefield. Any "as [this] enters the battlefield" or "[this] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2011/06/01: If Phyrexian Metamorph somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent (due to Mass Polymorph or Liliana Vess's third ability, for example), Phyrexian Metamorph can't become a copy of that permanent. You may choose only a permanent that's already on the battlefield.
2011/06/01: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Phyrexian Metamorph simply enters the battlefield as a 0/0 artifact creature and is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action (unless something else is raising its toughness).</Rulings>

2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/03/19: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.
2021/03/19: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The only difference between a colored artifact and a colorless artifact is, obviously, its color. Unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact requires colored mana to cast. Also unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact has a color in all zones. It will interact with cards that care about color. Other than that, a colored artifact behaves just like any other artifact.

2020/08/07: Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
2020/08/07: Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Kitesail Freebooter, won't happen when a permanent phases out.
2020/08/07: Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration such as that of Awakener Druid ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.
2020/08/07: Each Aura and Equipment attached to a permanent that's phasing out also phases out. They will phase in with that permanent and still be attached to it. Similarly, permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.
2020/08/07: Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
2020/08/07: A creature phased out by Oubliette doesn't phase in during its controller's untap step as normal. Rather, it phases in immediately after Oubliette leaves the battlefield.

<Artist>Chris Seaman</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489786</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/08/07: When Wound Reflection's ability resolves, it checks how much life each opponent lost over the course of the turn, then it causes that opponent to lose that much life. It doesn't matter how the opponent lost life or who caused it. It also doesn't matter if Wound Reflection wasn't on the battlefield at the time some or all of the life was lost.
2020/08/07: Wound Reflection's ability checks only whether life was lost. It doesn't care whether life was also gained. For example, if an opponent lost 4 life and gained 6 life during the turn, that player will have a higher life total than they started the turn with but Wound Reflection's ability will still cause that player to lose 4 life.
2020/08/07: If Wound Reflection's ability resolves, then an opponent loses life later in the same turn, that life loss is never counted by Wound Reflection.
2020/08/07: Multiple Wound Reflections each trigger separately. For example, if an opponent lost 1 life, the first one's triggered ability to resolve causes them to lose another 1 life. Since they've now lost 2 life, the next triggered ability causes them to lose 2 life, and the next 4, and so on.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Blasphemous Act). The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/11/10: Blasphemous Act's ability can't reduce the total cost to cast the spell below {R}.
2020/11/10: The total cost to cast Blasphemous Act is locked in before you pay that cost. For example, if there are three creatures on the battlefield, including one you can sacrifice to add {C} to your mana pool, the total cost of Blasphemous Act is {5}{R}. Then you can sacrifice the creature when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost.
2020/11/10: Although players may respond to Blasphemous Act once it's been cast, once it's announced, they can't respond before the cost is calculated and paid.</Rulings>

2016/06/08: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2016/06/08: If the spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/06/08: If the spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.

2020/08/07: You don't choose whether to sacrifice an artifact or which artifact you're sacrificing until the ability resolves. Once you decide to sacrifice an artifact (or not), it's too late for players to respond.</Rulings>

You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.
2021/03/19: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/03/19: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.
2021/03/19: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</Rulings>

<Artist>Dimitar Marinski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489862</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/08/07: Arixmethes can't be played as a land.
2020/08/07: Arixmethes isn't a land until after it has entered the battlefield. Effects such as that of Blood Moon won't affect its enters-the-battlefield ability. Similarly, replacement effects that modify how creatures you control enter the battlefield will see Arixmethes entering as a creature rather than a land. However, triggered abilities (such as landfall abilities) will see that a land has entered the battlefield and not a creature.
2020/08/07: Arixmethes can tap for mana the turn it enters the battlefield as long as it has slumber counters on it. If you can figure out how to untap it, that is.
2020/08/07: While Arixmethes is a land, it's still green and blue, it's still legendary, and its mana value is still 4.
2020/08/07: Arixmethes's effect causing it to be a land overwrites any earlier effects that gave it additional types. For example, a Phyrexian Metamorph that copies Arixmethes will be a land, not an artifact land, until its slumber counters are removed.
2020/08/07: Arixmethes's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2020/08/07: Once Arixmethes is a creature again, it can attack on the same turn as long as you've controlled it since your most recent turn began.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: If a permanent has +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters on it, they're removed in pairs as a state-based action so that the permanent has only one of those kinds of counters on it.
2021/03/19: To proliferate, you can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
2021/03/19: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2021/03/19: Players can respond to a spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/08/07: A spell is historic if it has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga enchantment subtype. Having two of those qualities doesn't make a spell more historic than another or provide an additional bonus—a spell either is historic or it isn't.
2020/08/07: An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/08/07: Kaalia's ability doesn't trigger if it attacks a planeswalker.
2020/08/07: Although the creature you put onto the battlefield is an attacking creature, it was never declared as an attacking creature. This means that abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger when it enters the battlefield attacking.
2020/08/07: Any effects that say that the Angel, Demon, or Dragon creature can't attack (such as that of Propaganda or if the creature has defender) affect only the declaration of attackers. They won't stop the creature from entering the battlefield attacking.
2020/08/07: If the opponent Kaalia attacked is no longer in the game when its ability resolves, you may put an Angel, Demon, or Dragon creature card onto the battlefield tapped, but it won't be attacking anyone and it won't be an attacking creature.
2020/08/07: If Kaalia attacks an opponent, the creature enters attacking that player even if Kaalia is somehow attacking a different player or planeswalker as its triggered ability resolves.</Rulings>

<CardText>The first spell you cast each turn has cascade. (When you cast your first spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom of your library in a random order.)</CardText>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489879</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/08/07: If the first spell you cast in a turn already has cascade, both cascade abilities will trigger separately. Deal with them one at a time: First one cascade ability will resolve, and you'll cast the applicable card if you want. That new spell will resolve. Then the other cascade ability will resolve in the same way. Finally, the original spell will resolve.
2020/08/07: This effect takes into account spells that were cast earlier in the turn before Maelstrom Nexus entered the battlefield, including any spells still on the stack. If you've already cast any spells that turn (including Maelstrom Nexus itself), this ability won't give any of your spells cascade that turn.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If cascade allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half but not both halves.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: Due to a recent rules change to cascade, not only do you stop exiling cards if you exile a nonland card with lesser mana value than the spell with cascade, but the resulting spell you cast must also have lesser mana value. Previously, in cases where a card's mana value differed from the resulting spell, such as with some modal double-faced cards or cards with an Adventure, you could cast a spell with a higher mana value than the exiled card.
2021/06/18: A spell's mana value is determined only by its mana cost. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions.
2021/06/18: Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2021/06/18: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2021/06/18: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
2021/06/18: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/08/07: Maelstrom Pulse has only one target. Other permanents with the same name will be destroyed even if they have hexproof or protection.
2020/08/07: If the target permanent is an illegal target by the time Maelstrom Pulse tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. You won't destroy any permanents at all. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), you do destroy other permanents with the same name.
2020/08/07: The name of a token is the same as the subtypes it was created with unless the token is a copy of another permanent or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name. For example, a 1/1 red Elemental creature token created by Young Pyromancer and a 4/4 green Elemental creature token created by Walker of the Grove are both named "Elemental."</Rulings>

<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489885</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Progenitor Mimic copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2013/04/15: The original Progenitor Mimic will create tokens, but those token copies will not.
2013/04/15: If you choose to have Progenitor Mimic enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature, the triggered ability it gains will become part of its copiable values. For example, suppose Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear, a 2/2 green Bear creature with mana cost {1}{G}. The resulting object is a 2/2 green Bear creature named Runeclaw Bear with mana cost {1}{G} and with "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn't a token, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of this creature." If another Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of that creature, it will be a Runeclaw Bear with two instances of the triggered ability.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature is a token, Progenitor Mimic copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Copying a token doesn't make Progenitor Mimic become a token.
2013/04/15: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2013/04/15: If Progenitor Mimic somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2013/04/15: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

2011/09/22: You can't pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. Notably, if the original spell was kicked (or kicked a certain number of times), the copy will also be kicked (or kicked that many times).
2011/09/22: If the creature that caused Riku's second ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, you can still pay {G}{U}. If you do, you'll still put a token onto the battlefield. That token has the copiable values of the characteristics of that creature as it last existed on the battlefield.
2011/09/22: As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it.

2020/08/07: The Germ token enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature and the Equipment becomes attached to it before state-based actions would cause the token to die. Abilities that trigger as the token enters the battlefield see that a 0/0 creature entered the battlefield.

<Multiverseid>489959</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/12/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied artifact will trigger when Sculpting Steel enters the battlefield. Any "as enters the battlefield" or "enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen artifact will also work. For example, if Sculpting Steel copies an artifact creature with sunburst, the copy will get +1/+1 counters based on the number of different colors of mana used to pay Sculpting Steel's total cost. If Sculpting Steel copies a noncreature artifact with sunburst, the copy will get charge counters based on the number of different colors of mana used to pay Sculpting Steel's total cost.
2007/07/15: Sculpting Steel doesn't copy whether the original artifact is tapped or untapped. It also doesn't copy any counters on that artifact, any Auras or Equipment attached to that artifact, or any effects that are currently affecting that artifact — you get exactly what's printed on the chosen card and nothing more. So if you copy an animated Chimeric Staff, for example, you get a normal, nonanimated Chimeric Staff.
2007/07/15: If the chosen artifact is copying something else (for example, if the chosen artifact is another Sculpting Steel), then your Sculpting Steel enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen artifact copied.
2007/07/15: If the chosen artifact is a token, your Sculpting Steel copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Your Sculpting Steel is not considered to be a token.
2007/07/15: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Sculpting Steel stays on the battlefield as an artifact that doesn't do much of anything.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/08/07: Sundering Titan's ability isn't targeted. When it resolves, Sundering Titan's controller must choose one land for each basic land type (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest), and then they are destroyed simultaneously.
2020/08/07: Players can't take actions in between the time you choose the lands and the time you destroy them. Notably, they can't activate mana abilities of those lands.
2020/08/07: If one of the basic land types isn't present, it isn't chosen. If the only land of a certain type is one you control, you must choose it.
2020/08/07: If a land has more than one basic land type, it can be chosen more than once.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/08/07: Maze of Ith really is a land with no mana ability. It doesn't tap for colorless mana.

2020/08/07: The creature isn't removed from combat; it just has its damage prevented. It's still an attacking creature until the combat phase is complete.
2020/08/07: You can activate Maze of Ith's ability targeting an attacking creature you control during the combat damage step or the end of combat step. It'll be untapped and the damage it had already dealt won't be undone.</Rulings>

<Artist>Scott Chou</Artist>
<Multiverseid>489996</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: If Mishra's Factory becomes a creature and you haven't controlled it continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, you won't be able to activate its first or last abilities, and it won't be able to attack (unless something is giving it haste).
2021/06/18: Once Mishra's Factory is an Assembly-Worker, it is a legal target for its last ability. For example, you could animate Mishra's Factory, block with it, then activate it last ability to make it 3/3.
2021/06/18: If Mishra's Factory is already a creature, activating the second ability will override any previous effects that set its power and/or toughness to specific values. Other effects that are affecting its power and/or toughness, including +1/+1 counters and the effects of spells like Giant Growth, will continue to apply.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: The copy effect created by the last activated ability doesn't have a duration. It will last until Thespian's Stage leaves the battlefield or another copy effect overwrites it. The permanent will no longer have the first ability of Thespian's Stage.
2018/12/07: A land's copiable values are those printed on it, as modified by other copy effects. Counters and other effects aren't copied. Notably, if you copy a land that is also a creature because of a temporary effect (such as Celestial Colonnade), Thespian's Stage will become just the "unanimated" land.
2018/12/07: Thespian's Stage doesn't become untapped when it becomes a copy, even if the target land is untapped.
2018/12/07: No enters-the-battlefield abilities of the land Thespian's Stage is copying will trigger. Thespian's Stage was already on the battlefield. Similarly, no "as this land enters the battlefield" or "this land enters the battlefield with" effects, such as that of Dark Depths, will apply.</Rulings>
