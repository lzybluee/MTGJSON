<Rulings>2012/05/01: If a spell or activated ability has a cost that requires a player to pay life (as Griselbrand's activated ability does) or sacrifice a creature (as Fling does), that spell or ability can't be cast or activated.
2012/05/01: Other things may still cause players to pay life or sacrifice creatures, such as a resolving spell or ability.
2012/05/01: Angel of Jubilation's last ability doesn't look for specific words on other cards. Rather, it stops players from taking specific actions. For example, you couldn't activate an ability with an activation of cost of "Sacrifice an artifact:" by sacrificing an artifact creature (although you could sacrifice a noncreature artifact).</Rulings>

<Artist>Igor Kieryluk</Artist>
<Multiverseid>240156</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: It's important to reveal a card with miracle before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand.
2018/07/13: You can reveal and cast a card with miracle on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2018/07/13: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2018/07/13: You don't have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don't wish to cast it at that time.
2018/07/13: You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won't be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
2018/07/13: You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing rules based on the card's type.
2018/07/13: Miracle is an alternative cost to cast the spell with miracle. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a miracle cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to cast it using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.</Rulings>

2018/03/16: When an effect returns the exiled card "under your control," you control it indefinitely after that. In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any creatures you control from Cloudshift's effect are exiled.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steve Prescott</Artist>
<Multiverseid>240072</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: Divine Deflection's only target is the permanent or player it may deal damage to. You choose that target as you cast Divine Deflection, not at the time it prevents damage.
2012/05/01: If the targeted permanent or player is an illegal target by the time Divine Deflection resolves, the entire spell doesn't resolve. No damage will be prevented.
2012/05/01: Divine Deflection can prevent damage that would be dealt to you, one or more creatures you control, and/or one or more planeswalkers you control.
2012/05/01: Divine Deflection can prevent damage from multiple sources dealing damage simultaneously (such as during combat). If the chosen value for X won't prevent all the damage, you choose which sources to prevent damage from.
2012/05/01: If damage is dealt to multiple permanents you control, or is dealt to you and at least one permanent you control, you choose which of that damage to prevent if the chosen value for X won't prevent all the damage. For example, if 3 damage would be dealt to you and to each of two creatures you control, and Divine Deflection will prevent the next 3 damage, you might choose to prevent the next 2 damage it would deal to you and the next 1 damage it would deal to one of the creatures, among other choices. You don't decide until the point at which the damage would be dealt.
2012/05/01: Divine Deflection's effect is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, Divine Deflection (not the original source) deals damage to the targeted permanent or player as part of that prevention effect. Divine Deflection is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don't affect this damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.
2012/05/01: If Divine Deflection prevents damage, excess damage (if any) dealt by that source is dealt at the same time. Immediately afterward, as part of that same prevention effect, Divine Deflection deals its damage. This happens before state-based actions are checked, and before the spell or ability that caused damage to be dealt resumes its resolution.
2012/05/01: Whether the targeted permanent or player is still a legal target is not checked after Divine Deflection resolves. For example, if a creature targeted by Divine Deflection gains shroud after Divine Deflection resolves, Divine Deflection can still deal damage to that creature.
2012/05/01: If Divine Deflection can't deal damage to the targeted permanent or player (because the creature is no longer on the battlefield, or is no longer a creature, or the player is no longer in the game, for example), it will still prevent damage. It just won't deal any damage itself.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>262703</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: Each player chooses the order that creatures they own are put onto the bottom of their library. This order isn't revealed to other players.
2018/07/13: You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.
2018/07/13: Miracle is an alternative cost to cast the spell with miracle. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: It's important to reveal a card with miracle before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand.
2018/07/13: You can reveal and cast a card with miracle on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2018/07/13: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2018/07/13: You don't have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don't wish to cast it at that time.
2018/07/13: You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won't be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
2018/07/13: You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing rules based on the card's type.
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a miracle cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to cast it using its miracle ability.</Rulings>

For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2018/07/13: You don't have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don't wish to cast it at that time.
2018/07/13: You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won't be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
2018/07/13: You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing rules based on the card's type.
2018/07/13: Miracle is an alternative cost to cast the spell with miracle. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a miracle cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to cast it using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.</Rulings>

<Type>Enchantment — Aura</Type>

<CardText>Enchant creature
When Infinite Reflection enters the battlefield attached to a creature, each other nontoken creature you control becomes a copy of that creature.
Nontoken creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of enchanted creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Igor Kieryluk</Artist>
<Multiverseid>271117</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: Infinite Reflection can enchant a creature controlled by another player.
2012/05/01: If Infinite Reflection enters the battlefield attached to a creature and then becomes attached to a different creature before its enters-the-battlefield trigger resolves, each other nontoken creature you control will become a copy of the first creature.
2012/05/01: If Infinite Reflection leaves the battlefield or becomes attached to a different creature, none of the copy effects end. Your creatures will still be copies of whatever creature each was a copy of.
2012/05/01: If Infinite Reflection enters the battlefield attached to a token creature, the nontoken creatures that become copies of that creature are not themselves tokens.
2012/05/01: Creatures you control don't copy whether the enchanted creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it, whether it has any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2012/05/01: Because creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of the enchanted creature, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities printed on such creatures won't trigger. However, if the enchanted creature has any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities, those will trigger.
2012/05/01: Replacement effects that modify how a permanent enters the battlefield are now applied in the following order: control-changing effects (such as Gather Specimens), then copy effects (such as the abilities of Infinite Reflection and Clone), then all other effects.
2012/05/01: If a creature such as Clone is entering the battlefield under your control, there will be two copy effects to apply: the creature's own and Infinite Reflection's. No matter what order these effects are applied, the creature will be a copy of the enchanted creature when it enters the battlefield.
2012/05/01: Other enters-the-battlefield replacement abilities printed on the creature entering the battlefield won't be applied because the creature will already be a copy of the enchanted creature at that point (and therefore it won't have those abilities). For example, if the enchanted creature is Serra Angel, a creature that normally enters the battlefield tapped will enter the battlefield as an untapped copy of Serra Angel, and a creature that would normally enter the battlefield with counters on it will enter the battlefield as a copy of Serra Angel with no counters.
2012/05/01: External abilities may still affect how a creature enters the battlefield. For example, if your opponent controls Urabrask the Hidden, which reads, in part, "Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped," a creature entering the battlefield under your control will be a tapped copy of the enchanted creature.
2012/05/01: If you control more than one Infinite Reflection, you can apply those copy effects in any order. Creatures you control will enter the battlefield as a copy of the one whose copy effect you apply last.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/05/01: Second Guess can't be cast unless the spell it targets is the second spell cast this turn.

2012/05/01: Most spells and abilities that copy a spell create that copy on the stack. These copies are not cast and won't count toward the number of spells cast that turn. However, a few (like Isochron Scepter's ability) instruct you to copy a spell and "cast the copy." These spells are cast and will count toward the number of spells cast that turn.</Rulings>

2012/05/01: If an activated ability of a card in exile references the card it's printed on by name, treat Dark Impostor's version of that ability as though it referenced Dark Impostor by name instead. For example, if Marrow Bats (which says "Pay 4 life: Regenerate Marrow Bats") is exiled with Dark Impostor, Dark Impostor has the ability "Pay 4 life: Regenerate Dark Impostor."
2012/05/01: Dark Impostor can target and exile a permanent that's only a creature temporarily, like an animated land. However, because that card isn't a creature card, Dark Impostor won't have any of that card's activated abilities.

<Multiverseid>240138</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: The ability granted by Dual Casting can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
2012/05/01: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2012/05/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2012/05/01: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones.
2012/05/01: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2012/05/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling and then copy it with the ability granted by Dual Casting, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: A creature dealt damage by Pillar of Flame that dies this turn will be exiled even if it wasn't the target of Pillar of Flame (because the damage was redirected somehow). If the target creature isn't dealt damage (most likely because the damage was prevented), it won't be exiled if it dies that turn.
2017/11/17: A creature dealt damage by Pillar of Flame will be exiled no matter why the creature would die that turn. It could have its toughness reduced to 0 or less or be destroyed by another spell or ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: Gisela doubles damage dealt to opponents and permanents your opponents control from any source, including sources controlled by those opponents.
2018/03/16: If multiple replacement effects would modify how damage would be dealt, the player being dealt damage (or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage) chooses the order in which to apply those effects.
2018/03/16: If damage dealt by a source you control is being divided or assigned among multiple permanents an opponent controls or among an opponent and one or more permanents they control simultaneously, divide the original amount and double the results. For example, if you attack with a 5/5 creature with trample and your opponent blocks with a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then doubled to 4 and 6 damage, respectively. You can't double the damage to 10 first and then assign 2 to the creature and 8 to the player.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>240033</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/12/07: As a spell or ability an opponent controls resolves, if it would force you to sacrifice a permanent, you just don't. That part of the effect does nothing. If that spell or ability gives you the option to sacrifice a permanent (as Desecration Demon does), you can't take that option.
2018/12/07: If a spell or ability an opponent controls states something happens unless you sacrifice a permanent (as Mogis, God of Slaughter does), you can't choose to sacrifice a permanent. On the other hand, if a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to sacrifice a permanent unless you perform an action (as Killing Wave does), you can choose whether or not to perform the action. If you don't perform the action, nothing happens, since you can't sacrifice any permanents.
2018/12/07: Sigarda's ability affects only sacrifices. It won't stop a creature from dying due to lethal damage or having 0 toughness, and it won't stop a permanent from being put into its owner's graveyard due to the "legend rule." None of these are sacrifices; they're the result of game rules.</Rulings>

2015/06/22: Effects setting Angel's Tomb's base power and toughness to specific values that begin to apply after Angel's Tomb has become a creature will override the effect of Angel's Tomb.
