<Rulings>2012/10/01: If Angel of Serenity leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability has resolved, its leaves-the-battlefield ability will trigger and do nothing. Then the enters-the-battlefield ability will resolve and exile the targeted creatures and/or creature cards indefinitely.
2013/01/24: You choose up to three total targets from among other creatures on the battlefield and creature cards in graveyards. You may choose zero targets.
2013/01/24: You choose the targets as part of putting the enters-the-battlefield trigger on the stack. Because that ability includes "you may," you choose whether to exile the targets when the ability resolves.
2013/01/24: If a creature targeted by the enters-the-battlefield ability dies before that ability resolves, it will become an illegal target even though it may be a creature card in a graveyard when the ability resolves. It won't be exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: The only legal target for Conjured Currency's ability is a permanent both owned and controlled by another player, although it doesn't have to be the same player. For example, a permanent owned by an opponent but controlled by your teammate (or another opponent) could be chosen as the target.
2012/10/01: The exchange occurs only if Conjured Currency and the target permanent are both on the battlefield and controlled by different players when the ability resolves. In addition, the target permanent must be one you neither own nor control. If any of these things aren't true when the ability tries to resolve, the exchange won't happen and neither permanent will change controllers.
2012/10/01: You don't necessarily have to control Conjured Currency when its ability resolves in order for the exchange to happen. If another player has gained control of Conjured Currency while the ability is on the stack, and a third player controls the target (and you don't own it), you may choose to have those two players exchange control of the relevant permanents.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: Jace's first ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers whenever a creature an opponent controls attacks. It doesn't matter which player or planeswalker that creature is attacking.
2012/10/01: You pick one of your opponents when Jace's second ability resolves. The ability doesn't target that opponent. All players may see the revealed cards and offer opinions. You (not your opponent) choose which pile is put into your hand and which pile is put on the bottom of your library.

2012/10/01: When resolving Jace's third ability, you search each player's library (including yours) and exile the nonland cards before casting any of them.
2012/10/01: For each library, the search is complete only when you explicitly say it is. For example, you can look through one player's library, set that library down, look at another player's library, choose a nonland card in the first library, then choose a nonland card in the second library. Don't reveal any cards from those libraries to any other player until you exile them.
2012/10/01: You cast the cards by putting them on the stack one at a time, choosing modes, targets, and so on. The last card you cast will be the first one to resolve.
2012/10/01: When casting a card this way, ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
2012/10/01: If you can't cast a card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, or if you choose not to cast one, it will remain exiled. Jace's ability won't allow you to cast it later.
2012/10/01: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2012/10/01: If a card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.</Rulings>

The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2012/10/01: If the creature card leaves the graveyard before the delayed triggered ability resolves, it won't return to the battlefield. This is also true if the card leaves the graveyard and returns to the graveyard before that ability resolves.
2012/10/01: The phrase "with an additional +1/+1 counter on it" means that the creature enters the battlefield with one more +1/+1 counter than it would normally enter the battlefield with. It doesn't keep any counters it had on it when it died.
2012/10/01: In a multiplayer game, if more than one player controls a Grave Betrayal and a creature controlled by none of those players dies, each Grave Betrayal will create a delayed triggered ability at the beginning of the next end step. The first such ability to resolve will return the creature. Usually, this will be one controlled by the player furthest from the active player in turn order.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: The controller of a creature that attacks if able still chooses which player or planeswalker it attacks.
2012/10/01: If, during a player's declare attacker's step, a creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2012/10/01: If you cast Chemister's Trick with overload, only creatures you don't control that are on the battlefield when Chemister's Trick resolves are affected. Creatures that come under another player's control later in the turn are not.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: Spells and abilities that would cause a player to gain life still resolve, but the life-gain part has no effect.
2012/10/01: Effects that would replace gaining life with another effect won't apply because it's impossible for players to gain life.
2012/10/01: If an effect says to set a player's life total to a certain number and that number is higher than the player's current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than the player's current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
2012/10/01: The amount of life lost is calculated when the triggered ability resolves. For example, if a player has 20 life and there are two Havoc Festivals on the battlefield, the first ability will cause that player to lose 10 life and then the second ability will cause that player to lose 5 life.
2012/10/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability triggers for each player. Any life loss is applied to the team's life total. For example, if the team has 30 life, the first ability will cause the player (and thus the team) to lose 15 life and then the second ability will cause the other player (and thus the team) to lose 8 life. The team will end up having 7 life.</Rulings>

2012/10/01: When the second ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2012/10/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2012/10/01: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2012/10/01: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Sphinx's Revelation does), the copy has the same value of X.
2012/10/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you copy a spell that you cast by paying its overload cost, the copy will resolve as though its overload cost had been paid as well.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: Rakdos's last ability cares about the total life lost, not necessarily what an opponent's life total is compared to what it was at the beginning of the turn. For example, if an opponent loses 5 life and then gains 10 life in a turn, creature spells you cast will cost {5} less to cast.
2020/11/10: If an opponent lost life and subsequently lost the game, Rakdos's first ability is satisfied, and its last ability counts that loss of life.
2020/11/10: Rakdos's last ability can't reduce the colored mana requirement of a creature spell you cast.
2020/11/10: If there are additional costs to cast a creature spell, such as a kicker cost or the commander tax, apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
2020/11/10: Rakdos's last ability won't reduce the cost to cast Rakdos itself. It applies only to creature spells you cast once Rakdos is on the battlefield.</Rulings>
