<CardText>Lands you control are Plains.
Nonland permanents you control are white. The same is true for spells you control and nonland cards you own that aren't on the battlefield.
You may spend white mana as though it were mana of any color. You may spend other mana only as though it were colorless mana.</CardText>
<Artist>Liz Danforth</Artist>
<Multiverseid>106639</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: Will not add or remove Snow Supertype from a land.
2004/10/04: Celestial Dawn does not change the type of lands which are not on the battlefield. Lands not on the battlefield are what they say they are.
2004/10/04: The effect to turn all your non-land cards (including artifacts) white is the effect of a static ability. Thus, a color change on a permanent prior to Celestial Dawn entering the battlefield will be overridden by Celestial Dawn's effect.
2004/10/04: You may use a different color mana than the color required for spells and abilities that require a specific color. If you do, and the spell or ability checks the actual color of the mana, it can tell the difference.
2004/10/04: If you pay white mana to activate an ability that can only be activated by spending another color of mana, then any limitations on activating the ability (such as the number of times it can be activated each turn) still apply as if you spent the proper color.
2004/10/04: Celestial Dawn no longer changes mana symbols on cards.
2006/09/25: Mana produced by spells you control and nonland permanents you control isn't affected by Celestial Dawn. Llanowar Elves will produce {G}, for example. However, any colored mana may be spent only on the colorless part of costs.
2006/09/25: Land cards you own that aren't on the battlefield aren't changed to Plains.
2006/09/25: If you have nonwhite mana in your mana pool when Celestial Dawn enters the battlefield, it remains there but you can spend it only on the colorless part of costs.
2006/09/25: If you use a text-changing effect such as Mind Bend on Celestial Dawn to change the word "Plains" to a different land type, your lands are all of that new land type, and they will produce mana of the appropriate color for that type.
2006/09/25: If a permanent enters the battlefield while Celestial Dawn is on the battlefield, and then Celestial Dawn leaves the battlefield, the permanent's color will revert to the colors in its mana cost.
2017/09/29: If a nonbasic land has an ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped, it will lose that ability before it applies. The same is also true of any other abilities that modify how a land enters the battlefield or apply "as" a land enters the battlefield, such as the first ability of Cavern of Souls. This is a change from previous rulings.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: If the creature is only a creature due to an effect, it still goes to your hand. This includes any way to animate a card.
2004/10/04: Token creatures cease to exist if they leave the battlefield, so this effect will not let you get them in your hand.
2006/07/15: The last ability is now a triggered ability, not a replacement effect. That means your opponent has the opportunity to remove the card from your graveyard while the triggered ability is still on the stack.
2006/09/25: Unless something weird happens, the card you draw as a result of the second ability will be the card you revealed.

2004/10/04: The generic X cost is still considered generic even if there is a requirement that a specific color be used for it. For example, "only black mana can be spent this way". This distinction is important for effects which reduce the generic portion of a spell's cost.
2004/10/04: This can lower the cost to zero, but not below zero.

<Artist>Eric Peterson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>108861</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The trigger occurs when you use the Morph ability to turn the card face up, or when an effect turns it face up. It will not trigger on being revealed or on leaving the battlefield.
2013/04/15: If a spell with split second is on the stack, you can still respond by turning this creature face up and targeting that spell with the trigger. This is because split second only stops players from casting spells or activating abilities, while turning a creature face up is a special action.
2018/03/16: You don't choose the new target for the spell until Willbender's triggered ability resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets to choose from, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target of that spell has somehow become illegal itself.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets multiple things, you can't target it with Willbender's triggered ability, even if all but one of those targets have become illegal.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets the same player or object multiple times, you can't target it with Willbender's ability.</Rulings>

2005/08/01: "Legend" is no longer a creature type, and may not be chosen.
2005/08/01: If you choose Wall, then your creatures can still attack because creature types don't confer abilities such as defender (any more than, say, choosing creature type Bird would confer flying).

2017/09/29: Replacement effects that modify creatures of a certain type as they enter the battlefield will apply (or not apply) after you apply this effect.

Madness {R} (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)</CardText>
<Artist>Greg Hildebrandt & Tim Hildebrandt</Artist>
<Multiverseid>108880</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its mana value. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

If this happens and the damage brings that player's life total to 0 or less, the life-gaining effect will raise their life total above 0 again before the player would lose the game.</Rulings>

2006/09/25: "Until the beginning of your next upkeep" means the effect wears off as soon as your next upkeep starts. Your last chance to play the card is usually the End step of the player who immediately precedes you.
2006/09/25: The exiled card is played using the normal rules for timing and priority for its card type, as well as any other applicable restrictions. You'll have to pay its mana cost. The only thing that's different is you're casting it from the Exile zone.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: Everything about the original spell is copied, including any decisions made on announcement, such as whether it was kicked or its Buyback cost was paid. Effects on the spell, such as Sleight of Mind or Flashback, are not copied.
2004/10/04: If the copied spell requires a target and there are no legal targets, then the copy has the same target (which should be illegal) as the original.
2004/10/04: If the spell is countered before the triggered ability resolves, then the ability will make a copy of how the spell looked right before it was countered.
2004/10/04: It triggers once per spell, so you can't get multiple copies of a spell using this card. And since this card is legendary, you can't control more than one.
2004/10/04: The copy is not "cast" so it will not trigger anything that triggers on a spell being cast.
2004/10/04: You choose whether or not to pay when the triggered ability resolves.
2004/10/04: You are not required to choose new targets. If you do choose, then the targets must be legal. If you don't change them, the spell is placed on the stack whether or not the targets are legal. The legality of the targets is always checked on resolution of the spell, so the spell may be countered at that time if all of its targets are illegal.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: Token creatures cease to exist when they leave the battlefield, so this effect just exiles them with no chance to bring them back like you can with cards.
