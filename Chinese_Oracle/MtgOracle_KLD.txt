<Rulings>2016/09/20: After the creature returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the creature that was exiled. It won't be in combat or have any additional abilities it may have had before it was exiled. Any +1/+1 counters on it or Auras attached to it are removed, and any Equipment will no longer be attached.
2016/09/20: If a creature token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.</Rulings>

Whenever Aetherstorm Roc or another creature enters the battlefield under your control, you get {E} (an energy counter).
Whenever Aetherstorm Roc attacks, you may pay {E}{E}. If you do, put a +1/+1 counter on it and tap up to one target creature defending player controls.</CardText>
<Artist>Scott Murphy</Artist>
<Multiverseid>417576</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: Aetherstorm Roc's second triggered ability resolves before blockers are chosen. A creature tapped this way won't be able to block.
2016/09/20: You don't have to target a creature with Aetherstorm Roc's last ability. If you do choose a target, and that target becomes illegal, the ability doesn't resolve and you won't be able to pay {E}{E} to put a counter on Aetherstorm Roc.
2016/09/20: A creature entering the battlefield at the same time as Aetherstorm Roc causes its first triggered ability to trigger.
2017/02/09: If a triggered ability with one or more targets states that you "may pay" some amount of {E}, and each permanent that it targets has become an illegal target, the ability doesn't resolve. You can't pay {E} even if you want to.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/02/09: Some triggered abilities state that you "may pay" a certain amount of {E}. You can't pay that amount multiple times to multiply the effect. You simply choose whether or not to pay that amount of {E} as the ability resolves, and no player may take actions to try to stop the ability's effect after you make your choice.
2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/09/20: When you attach Captured by the Consulate to an opponent's creature, you still control Captured by the Consulate. Its last ability triggers whenever your opponents cast a spell with a single target, not when an opponent of the creature's controller casts a spell with a single target.
2016/09/20: When a player casts an Aura spell, it targets the creature that it will enchant and may cause Captured by the Consulate's last ability to trigger.
2016/09/20: If a spell has multiple targets, it doesn't have a single target even if the same object is chosen for each of those targets.
2016/09/20: If the spell can't target the enchanted creature, its target remains unchanged.
2016/09/20: If there is more than one Captured by the Consulate on the battlefield, the triggered ability of each one will change the target if able. The last one to resolve determines what that spell finally targets. If one player controls more than one Capture by the Consulate, they choose the order in which they resolve. If multiple players control those Auras, the first player among them in turn order (starting with the player whose turn it is now) is the one whose triggered ability resolves last.
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards. These cards have the Planeswalker symbol in their text box; this symbol has no effect on gameplay.

<Multiverseid>417582</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: First the player whose turn it is chooses permanents they control, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by players who chose before them. All of the unchosen nonland permanents are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/09/20: A permanent with more than one type may be chosen as either of the types or both. For example, an artifact creature may be chosen as the artifact, the creature, or both. Choosing the same permanent twice this way has the same result as choosing it once.
2016/09/20: Cataclysmic Gearhulk will be sacrificed to its own ability if you don't choose it as your artifact or your creature.
2016/09/20: Lands can't be chosen and won't be sacrificed, even if they have other types (such as an artifact land).
2016/09/20: If you don't control any permanents of one of the types, you'll still choose the permanents of the types you do control.</Rulings>

2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/02/09: Some triggered abilities state that you "may pay" a certain amount of {E}. You can't pay that amount multiple times to multiply the effect.

<Rulings>2016/09/20: If a permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2016/09/20: The mana value of a token that isn't a copy of another object is 0. A token that is a copy of another object has the same mana cost as that object.
2016/09/20: In a multiplayer game, if a permanent's owner leaves the game after you've gained control of it, the permanent leaves with that player. If you leave the game before that player, the control-change effect ends.
2016/09/20: If the target artifact or creature has a mana value of 0, you may choose to pay zero energy and gain control of it.
2016/09/20: You choose the target artifact or creature as you cast Confiscation Coup. You don't choose whether or not to pay an amount of {E} until Confiscation Coup resolves. If the target becomes an illegal target, Confiscation Coup won't resolve and you won't get {E}{E}{E}{E}.

2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.

<Artist>Kieran Yanner</Artist>
<Multiverseid>417635</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2016/09/20: If you chose the second mode, the token is an artifact in addition to its other types. This is a copiable value of the token that other effects may copy.
2016/09/20: If the copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2016/09/20: If the copied permanent is copying something else (for example, if the copied permanent is an Altered Ego), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that permanent copied.
2016/09/20: If the copied permanent is a token, the token created with Saheeli's Artistry copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that that created that token.
2016/09/20: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2016/09/20: If you choose both modes, you may target a single artifact creature twice and get two copies of that artifact creature.
2016/09/20: If you choose both modes, the tokens enter one at a time. Thus, if the token created by the second mode has an ability that triggers "whenever an artifact enters the battlefield," the token created by the first mode will already be on the battlefield and won't cause that ability to trigger.
2016/09/20: Any abilities that trigger during the resolution of Saheeli's Artistry will wait to be put onto the stack until Saheeli's Artistry finishes resolving. An ability that triggers on the first token entering the battlefield may target the second token and vice versa.</Rulings>

2016/09/20: An effect that instructs you to "cast" a card doesn't allow you to play lands.
2016/09/20: You pay the costs for the exiled card if you cast it. You may pay alternative costs such as emerge rather than the card's mana cost.
2016/09/20: Gonti doesn't change when you can cast the exiled card. For example, if you exile a creature card without flash, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2016/09/20: Casting the card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
2016/09/20: If you leave the game, the card remains exiled face down indefinitely. No player may look at it.</Rulings>

Players may take actions (such as casting instants) while the ability is waiting to resolve.

2016/09/20: If you cast the exiled card, you do so as part of the resolution of Chandra's ability. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored, but other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat") are not.
2016/09/20: You pay the costs for the exiled card if you cast it. You may pay alternative costs such as emerge rather than the card's mana cost.
2016/09/20: Loyalty abilities can't be mana abilities. Chandra's second ability uses the stack and can be countered or otherwise responded to. Like all loyalty abilities, it can be activated only once per turn, during your main phase, when the stack is empty, and only if no other loyalty abilities of the planeswalker have been activated this turn.
2016/09/20: The emblem created by Chandra's last ability is colorless. The damage it deals is from a colorless source.

2016/09/20: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2016/09/20: As Saheeli's last ability resolves, all three artifacts enter the battlefield at the same time. Triggered abilities of any of those artifacts will see all three entering the battlefield. Replacement effects, such as that of Sculpting Steel, won't see the others on the battlefield as they are being applied.
2016/09/20: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Saheeli's first ability causes 2 damage total to be dealt to the opposing team.</Rulings>

If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), its controller is dealt 3 damage.
2020/08/07: Whether or not you control an artifact is checked only after the creature is destroyed while Unlicensed Disintegration is resolving.

<Rulings>2016/09/20: As long as Cultivator's Caravan isn't an artifact creature, its {T} ability can be activated if it came under your control this turn.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.
2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/09/20: Once a player has announced an ability, Deadlock Trap can't be used to undo it. The last ability must be activated before that player activates that ability.
2016/09/20: Players may respond to Deadlock Trap's last ability by activating an ability of the target permanent if that ability's timing permissions allow it.
2016/09/20: After a planeswalker enters the battlefield, the active player receives priority and may activate an ability of that planeswalker before any player can activate Deadlock Trap's last ability.
2016/09/20: A tapped planeswalker can be attacked or dealt damage as normal.
2016/09/20: If the tapped creature somehow becomes untapped, it can attack and block as normal, but its abilities still can't be activated this turn.
2016/09/20: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text.
2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" to your mana pool can't give you energy counters.

<Rulings>2016/09/20: Ghirapur Orrery's first ability allows a player to play an additional land during their main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands.
2016/09/20: Ghirapur Orrery's first ability is cumulative if more than one is on the battlefield.
2016/09/20: No player may take actions in a turn before Ghirapur Orrery's second ability checks to see if it should trigger. If the player whose turn it is has any cards in hand, it won't trigger.
2016/09/20: If the player has any cards in hand as Ghirapur Orrery's second ability resolves, the ability does nothing. Notably, a second Ghirapur Orrery won't have a player draw another three cards unless the player empties their hand after resolving the first one's trigger.
2016/09/20: The draw step is after the upkeep step, so drawing a card as a turn-based action won't affect whether Ghirapur Orrery's second ability triggers.
2016/09/20: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Ghirapur Orrery's second ability triggers for each player on a team separately. If one player has cards in hand, it can still trigger for the other player.</Rulings>

2016/09/20: Fabricate doesn't cause the creature with the ability to enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters already on it.

Players may take actions (such as casting instants) while the ability is waiting to resolve.

For example, if you control three noncreature artifacts each with mana value 2, including one you can sacrifice to add {C} to your mana pool, the total cost of Metalwork Colossus is {5}.

<Rulings>2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>417799</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: Panharmonicon affects a permanent's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that permanent enters the battlefield. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
2021/03/19: Replacement effects are unaffected by Panharmonicon's ability. For example, a creature that enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter on it won't receive an additional +1/+1 counter.
2021/03/19: Abilities that apply "as [this artifact or creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a color with Gauntlet of Power, are also unaffected.
2021/03/19: You don't need to control the permanent entering the battlefield, only the permanent that has the triggered ability.
2021/03/19: Panharmonicon's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to put counters on a permanent, are also made individually.
2021/03/19: If you control two Panharmonicons, an artifact or creature entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Panharmonicon causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.
2021/03/19: If an artifact or creature entering the battlefield at the same time as Panharmonicon (including Panharmonicon itself) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2021/03/19: If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, additional instances of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability.
2021/03/19: In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' mana values. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.</Rulings>

Crew 1 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 1 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)</CardText>
<Artist>Richard Wright</Artist>
<Multiverseid>417806</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.</Rulings>
