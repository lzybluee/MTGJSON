2021/11/19: A cleave cost is an alternative cost that's paid instead of the spell's mana cost. Casting a spell for its cleave cost doesn't change the spell's mana value.
2021/11/19: You can't cast a spell for both its cleave cost and another alternative cost. For example, if an effect gives an Alchemist's Retrieval in your graveyard a flashback cost of {U}, you can't cast it from your graveyard for its cleave cost.

2021/11/19: In some unusual cases, you may end up putting the appropriate counters on more than one permanent. For example, if you control The Ozolith when Parish-Blade Trainee dies, you'll put the appropriate number of each kind of counter onto both The Ozolith and the target creature.
2021/11/19: If Parish-Blade Trainee has -1/-1 counters on it when it dies, the last ability will include those as well. This may result in the recipient also dying.
2021/11/19: A creature's training ability triggers only when both that creature and a creature with greater power are declared as attackers. Increasing a creature's power after attackers are declared won't cause a training ability to trigger.

<CardText>Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Voice of the Blessed.
As long as Voice of the Blessed has four or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has flying and vigilance.
As long as Voice of the Blessed has ten or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has indestructible.</CardText>
<Artist>Anastasia Ovchinnikova</Artist>
<Multiverseid>540879</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/11/19: The first ability of Voice of the Blessed triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life was gained.
2021/11/19: If Voice of the Blessed is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
2021/11/19: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Voice of the Blessed's first ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2021/11/19: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Voice of the Blessed triggers only once.
2021/11/19: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the first ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.
2021/11/19: Gaining flying after it has become blocked won't cause Voice of the Blessed to become unblocked.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/11/19: If a player has more cards in their hand than their maximum hand size during the cleanup step of that player's turn, that player discards until they have that many cards. A player's maximum hand size isn't checked at any time other than their own cleanup step.
2021/11/19: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you are affected by Null Profusion (an enchantment that sets a player's maximum hand size to two) and then resolve Inspired Idea without paying its cleave cost, your maximum hand size would be zero. However, if Null Profusion entered the battlefield after Inspired Idea resolved, your maximum hand size would be two.
2021/11/19: If you currently have no maximum hand size, then reducing your maximum hand size by three will have no effect. If the effect causing you to have no maximum hand size ends, Inspired Idea's effect will apply at that time.
2021/11/19: If you cast a spell for its cleave cost, that spell doesn't have any of the text in square brackets while it's on the stack.
2021/11/19: A cleave cost is an alternative cost that's paid instead of the spell's mana cost. Casting a spell for its cleave cost doesn't change the spell's mana value.
2021/11/19: You can't cast a spell for both its cleave cost and another alternative cost. For example, if an effect gives an Alchemist's Retrieval in your graveyard a flashback cost of {U}, you can't cast it from your graveyard for its cleave cost.
2021/11/19: If an effect allows you to "cast a spell without paying its mana cost," you can't cast that spell for its cleave cost.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/11/19: Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as equip and crew, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.

<Rulings>2021/11/19: Soulcipher Board's last ability triggers when a creature card is put into a graveyard from anywhere. This is different than an ability that triggers when a creature dies. Notably, a noncreature card on the battlefield that becomes a creature and dies (such as an animated land) won't cause this ability to trigger. Similarly, a creature card on the battlefield that has been made a noncreature permanent (such as one enchanted with Minimus Containment) will cause this ability to trigger when that card is put into your graveyard.
2021/11/19: Token creatures dying never cause Soulcipher Board's last ability to trigger.</Rulings>

<CardText>[+1]: Add {R}. Chandra, Dressed to Kill deals 1 damage to up to one target player or planeswalker.
[+1]: Exile the top card of your library. If it's red, you may cast it this turn.
[-7]: Exile the top five cards of your library. You may cast red spells from among them this turn. You get an emblem with "Whenever you cast a red spell, this emblem deals X damage to any target, where X is the amount of mana spent to cast that spell."</CardText>
<Artist>Viktor Titov</Artist>
<Multiverseid>541004</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/11/19: Chandra's first ability uses the stack and can be responded to, even if no targets were chosen. It doesn't count as a mana ability.
2021/11/19: Chandra's second ability checks the characteristics of the card you exiled to see if it's red. If the spell that card becomes somehow isn't red, you may still cast it. For example, Rowan, Scholar of Sparks, the front face of a modal double-faced card, is red. Will, Scholar of Frost, the back face of the same card, is blue. In exile, that card is red, so you may cast either face if you exile it with this ability.
2021/11/19: Chandra's last ability, by contrast, only allows you to cast spells that are red when you cast them, no matter what the card in exile is. If Rowan, Scholar of Sparks is exiled by this ability, you won't be able to cast Will, Scholar of Frost this way because it would be a blue spell.
2021/11/19: You must pay all costs for spells cast via Chandra's last two abilities. For the middle ability, you must also follow all timing restrictions.
2021/11/19: The emblem's triggered ability looks for the actual amount of mana spent to cast the spell. If an effect caused you to pay more or less mana for that spell as you cast it, that will be taken into account when determining the value of X. If an effect would counter that spell unless you pay some amount of mana, that mana doesn't count as mana spent to cast it.</Rulings>

2021/11/19: A cleave cost is an alternative cost that's paid instead of the spell's mana cost. Casting a spell for its cleave cost doesn't change the spell's mana value.
2021/11/19: You can't cast a spell for both its cleave cost and another alternative cost. For example, if an effect gives an Alchemist's Retrieval in your graveyard a flashback cost of {U}, you can't cast it from your graveyard for its cleave cost.
