<Rulings>2020/09/25: The value of X is determined only as Allied Assault resolves. Once that happens, the value of X won't change later in the turn even if the number of creatures in your party changes.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.</Rulings>

Whenever a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, you and that player each gain that much life.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: All first-strike combat damage is dealt at the same time, and, separately, all regular combat damage is dealt at the same time. If one of those amounts of combat damage is enough to cause the player being dealt damage to lose the game, Angel of Destiny's first triggered ability has you gain life, but the other player has already lost the game and can't gain life.
2020/09/25: If a creature you control somehow deals combat damage to you (most likely because its combat damage was redirected), you gain twice that much life as a single life-gaining event.
2020/09/25: If Angel of Destiny leaves the battlefield before your end step, its last ability won't trigger and won't cause a player to lose the game, even if Angel of Destiny attacked that player earlier.
2020/09/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Angel of Destiny's last ability can trigger as long as your team's life total is greater than your team's starting life total by 15 or more life.</Rulings>

For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Felix</Artist>
<Multiverseid>491639</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: If Journey to Oblivion leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
2020/09/25: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist. When the card returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the card that was exiled.
2020/09/25: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.
2020/09/25: Several cards have a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party. To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: If a spell has a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party, no player may attempt to change that number after you begin to cast the spell but before you pay the cost.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up.

2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2020/09/25: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2020/09/25: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2020/09/25: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2020/09/25: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2020/09/25: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2020/09/25: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2020/09/25: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2020/09/25: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: If an ability of a creature counts the number of creatures in your party, that number is counted as the ability resolves. If that creature is still on the battlefield when the ability resolves, it'll be counted if appropriate.
2020/09/25: Squad Commander's last ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+0 or gain indestructible.
2020/09/25: Once Squad Commander's last ability has resolved, the affected creatures won't lose +1/+0 or indestructible if you no longer have a full party.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.

2020/09/25: Tazri's activated ability lets you put up to two cards total into your hand, not two cards of each of the listed creature types.
2020/09/25: Ally is a creature type that doesn't appear in the Zendikar Rising set, but it has appeared in previous sets featuring the plane of Zendikar.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard.

2020/09/25: Several cards have a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party.

The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: If a spell has a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party, no player may attempt to change that number after you begin to cast the spell but before you pay the cost.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: Glasspool Mimic copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below), except that it's also a Shapeshifter Rogue. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Most notably, if it copies a creature that's not normally a creature, it won't be a creature.
2020/09/25: If Glasspool Mimic isn't a creature, most likely because it copied a creature that was only temporarily a creature, it won't be a Shapeshifter Rogue, even if it becomes a creature later.
2020/09/25: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2020/09/25: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Glasspool Mimic), then Glasspool Mimic enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2020/09/25: If another creature becomes a copy of Glasspool Mimic, that creature is also a Shapeshifter Rogue.
2020/09/25: If the chosen creature is a token, Glasspool Mimic copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Glasspool Mimic doesn't become a token in this case.
2020/09/25: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Glasspool Mimic enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2020/09/25: If Glasspool Mimic somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2020/09/25: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2020/09/25: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2020/09/25: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2020/09/25: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2020/09/25: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2020/09/25: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2020/09/25: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: Nimble Trapfinder's first ability checks only whether a permanent entered the battlefield under your control earlier in the turn and had one of the party creature types as it entered. It doesn't apply if an entering object gained the type later in the turn. It does apply if the entering object left your control since. It doesn't matter whether Nimble Trapfinder was under your control as that object entered.
2020/09/25: Nimble Trapfinder's second ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get the triggered ability.
2020/09/25: After Nimble Trapfinder's second ability has resolved, creatures you control keep the triggered ability for the turn even if you no longer have a full party later in the turn.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2020/09/25: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2020/09/25: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2020/09/25: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2020/09/25: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2020/09/25: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2020/09/25: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.</Rulings>

When Sea Gate Stormcaller enters the battlefield, copy the next instant or sorcery spell with mana value 2 or less you cast this turn when you cast it. If Sea Gate Stormcaller was kicked, copy that spell twice instead. You may choose new targets for the copies.</CardText>
<Artist>Anna Steinbauer</Artist>
<Multiverseid>491708</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. The new targets must be legal.
2020/09/25: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
2020/09/25: For spells with {X} in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine the spell's converted mana cost. If it's copied, the copy has the same value of X.
2020/09/25: Sea Gate Stormcaller's delayed triggered ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2020/09/25: A copy is created even if Sea Gate Stormcaller leaves the battlefield before its delayed triggered ability is created.
2020/09/25: A copy is created even if the spell that caused Sea Gate Stormcaller's delayed triggered ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2020/09/25: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. Notably, if the spell you copy was kicked, the copy or copies will also be kicked.
2020/09/25: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: Once you declare that you're activating Seafloor Stalker's ability, no player can take actions to try and change the number of creatures in your party and change the activation cost.
2020/09/25: Once a creature has blocked Seafloor Stalker, activating its ability won't cause it to become unblocked or remove that blocking creature from combat.
2020/09/25: You can activate Seafloor Stalker's ability more than once, even if it already can't be blocked this turn.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>491722</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: If there are no creatures in your party as Acquisitions Expert's ability resolves, the target opponent reveals no cards and you choose no card.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.
2020/09/25: If an ability of a creature counts the number of creatures in your party, that number is counted as the ability resolves. If that creature is still on the battlefield when the ability resolves, it'll be counted if appropriate.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: If you have a full party and wish to cast a spell with Coveted Prize's effect, you do so as part of the resolution of Coveted Prize after searching for a card. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing permissions based on a card's type are ignored.
2020/09/25: The card you search for may be the one you cast.
2020/09/25: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the card.
2020/09/25: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.
2020/09/25: Some cards refer to you having a "full party." This is true if the number of creatures in your party is four.
2020/09/25: Several cards have a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party. To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: If a spell has a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party, no player may attempt to change that number after you begin to cast the spell but before you pay the cost.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Malakir Blood-Priest's ability causes the opposing team to lose twice X life and you to gain X life.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.
2020/09/25: If an ability of a creature counts the number of creatures in your party, that number is counted as the ability resolves. If that creature is still on the battlefield when the ability resolves, it'll be counted if appropriate.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.

2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: An ability that triggers "whenever you gain life" triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life you gain.
2020/09/25: If you gain life at the same time Scion of the Swarm is dealt lethal damage, it dies before its ability can put a +1/+1 counter on it.
2020/09/25: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2020/09/25: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability will trigger only once.
2020/09/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

<CardText>Kicker {4}{B}
When you cast this spell, if it was kicked, each player loses half their life, rounded up.
Scourge of the Skyclaves's power and toughness are each equal to 20 minus the highest life total among players.</CardText>
<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Multiverseid>491760</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: The ability that defines Scourge of the Skyclaves's power and toughness applies in all zones, not just the battlefield.
2020/09/25: If the highest life total among players is greater than 20, Scourge of the Skyclaves has negative power and toughness equal to the difference.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered. Notably, Scourge of the Skyclaves may have its toughness change from less than 0 to greater than 0 as a result of its triggered ability before it resolves and enters the battlefield.
2020/09/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Scourge of the Skyclaves causes each team to lose twice half their life rounded up, which is their full life total or, if it's odd, that much life plus 1. This causes the game to end in a draw.
2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: Skyclave Shade's landfall ability triggers only if it's in your graveyard immediately after the land enters the battlefield.
2020/09/25: You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions for Skyclave Shade when casting it with the permission of its landfall ability. You must pay its mana cost (or, if another effect allows, an alternative cost). You may pay its kicker cost when casting it this way.
2020/09/25: After you cast Skyclave Shade from your graveyard, it's considered a new object, and the permission from its landfall ability won't apply to it again even if it returns to your graveyard later in the turn. You'll need to have another land enter the battlefield under your control after it has returned to your graveyard to cast it again.
2020/09/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2020/09/25: A landfall ability doesn't trigger if a permanent already on the battlefield becomes a land.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: If a spell has a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party, no player may attempt to change that number after you begin to cast the spell but before you pay the cost.
2020/09/25: Thwart the Grave's first target doesn't have to be one of the party creature types.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: Ardent Electromancer's ability uses the stack and players may respond to it. It isn't a mana ability because the event that causes it to trigger isn't a mana ability.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

This is different from abilities that say "If you do . . ." in that players may cast spells and activate abilities after mana is paid but before the damage is dealt.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: Moraug's first ability checks each turn how many times each creature has attacked. It counts times that creature attacked before Moraug was on the battlefield, and it stops applying if Moraug leaves the battlefield.
2020/09/25: Moraug's first ability counts how many times a creature has attacked, not how many times it has dealt damage. The first time a creature attacks in a turn, the +1/+0 bonus will apply to the combat damage it deals during that combat.
2020/09/25: A creature that enters the battlefield attacking hasn't attacked that combat. Moraug's ability won't count that combat. Unless that creature has haste, it won't be able to attack in additional combats this turn.
2020/09/25: If the landfall ability resolves during your precombat main phase, the additional combat phase will happen before your regular combat phase. You'll untap creatures you control at the beginning of the additional combat but not at the beginning of your regular combat.
2020/09/25: There won't be an additional main phase after the additional combat phase. For example, if the landfall ability resolves twice during your postcombat main phase, you'll get two consecutive additional combat phases after your main phase (untapping your creatures at the beginning of each), followed by your ending phase.
2020/09/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.

<Artist>Grzegorz Rutkowski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>491823</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: Ancient Greenwarden doesn't change the times when you can play those lands. You can still play only one land per turn, and only during your main phase when you have priority and the stack is empty.
2020/09/25: Ancient Greenwarden doesn't allow you to activate abilities (such as cycling) of land cards in your graveyard.
2020/09/25: Ancient Greenwarden allows you to play a modal double-faced card's land face, but not a nonland face.
2020/09/25: Ancient Greenwarden's third ability affects a land's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that land enters the battlefield, such as landfall abilities. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
2020/09/25: Replacement effects are unaffected by Ancient Greenwarden's third ability. This includes any abilities that apply "as [this land] enters the battlefield" and any ability that says the land enters the battlefield with counters.
2020/09/25: Ancient Greenwarden's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to put counters on a permanent, are also made individually.
2020/09/25: The trigger event doesn't have to specifically refer to "lands." For example, an ability that triggers "whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control" would trigger twice if the entering land is also a creature.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers whenever you play a land won't trigger an additional time.
2020/09/25: Look at each permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger multiple times. For example, if you control Ashaya, Soul of the Wild, a nontoken creature entering the battlefield will cause any appropriate abilities to trigger an additional time.
2020/09/25: If you control two Ancient Greenwardens, a land entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Ancient Greenwarden causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.
2020/09/25: If a land entering the battlefield at the same time as Ancient Greenwarden (including Ancient Greenwarden itself if an effect causes it to be a land) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: The ability that defines Ashaya's power and toughness applies in all zones, not just the battlefield.
2020/09/25: As long as Ashaya is on the battlefield, it's affected by its second ability and thus its first ability counts itself.
2020/09/25: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Ashaya may become lethal if lands you control leave the battlefield during that turn.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: If you kick Inscription of Abundance, you can't choose any one mode more than once.
2020/09/25: If more than one mode is chosen, perform them in the order written. Nothing can happen in between, however, and no player may choose to take actions. Any abilities that trigger will be put onto the stack after the spell has finished resolving.
2020/09/25: If any targets become illegal, the other targets will still be affected as appropriate.

Normally, this means the token will simply be a Scute Swarm, but if any copy effects have affected the original Scute Swarm, the token will take those into account.

2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2020/09/25: If a creature the defending player controls can't block the target creature for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't block that creature. If there's a cost associated with having a creature block the attacking creature, the defending player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to block in that case either.
2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: The ability that adds creature types to Veteran Adventurer applies in all zones, not just the battlefield.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.
2020/09/25: Several cards have a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party. To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: An ability that triggers "whenever you gain life" triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life you gain.
2020/09/25: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2020/09/25: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability will trigger only once.
2020/09/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers whenever you gain life "for the first time each turn" won't trigger if you gain life during a turn before the permanent with that ability is on the battlefield, even if you gain life again later in the turn.</Rulings>

At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you have a full party, choose target nonland permanent an opponent controls. Until your next turn, it can't attack or block, and its activated abilities can't be activated.
Sacrifice Linvala: Choose hexproof or indestructible. Creatures you control gain that ability until end of turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Wayne Reynolds</Artist>
<Multiverseid>491877</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: Linvala's middle ability won't trigger at all if you don't have a full party as your combat phase begins. It won't affect the target if you don't have a full party as it resolves. The number of creatures in your party may change between these times, however.
2020/09/25: The nonland permanent remains affected until your next turn even if the number of creatures in your party changes or Linvala leaves the battlefield.
2020/09/25: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have a colon in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected.
2020/09/25: No abilities of the affected permanent can be activated, including mana abilities.
2020/09/25: In a multiplayer game, if you leave the game after Linvala's middle ability resolves but before your next turn begins, its effect lasts until your next turn would have begun. It neither expires immediately nor lasts indefinitely.
2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.
2020/09/25: Some cards refer to you having a "full party." This is true if the number of creatures in your party is four.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: If a spell has a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party, no player may attempt to change that number after you begin to cast the spell but before you pay the cost.</Rulings>

<CardText>Verazol, the Split Current enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each mana spent to cast it.
Whenever you cast a kicked spell, you may remove two +1/+1 counters from Verazol. If you do, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy. (A copy of a permanent spell becomes a token.)</CardText>
<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Multiverseid>491890</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/09/25: A copy is created even if the spell that caused Verazol's last ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2020/09/25: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. The new targets must be legal.
2020/09/25: The amount of mana you spent to cast Verazol is usually equal to its converted mana cost, normally 2 plus the value chosen for X. However, you also include any additional costs you pay, including the "commander tax" in a Commander game.
2020/09/25: If Verazol enters the battlefield without being cast, then no mana was spent to cast it. It enters the battlefield without any +1/+1 counters. If no other effects are increasing its toughness at that time, it will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2020/09/25: If another creature enters the battlefield as a copy of Verazol, consider how much mana was spent to cast that creature to determine how many +1/+1 counters it enters with.
2020/09/25: Verazol's last ability can copy any kicked spell, not just one with targets.
2020/09/25: You can't remove more than two counters as Verazol's last ability resolves to copy the spell more than once. You can't remove just one counter from it if it has only one. If Verazol leaves the battlefield while its last ability is on the stack, you can't remove two +1/+1 counters from it at all.
2020/09/25: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones. This doesn't apply to copying a permanent spell with a modal enters-the-battlefield ability.
2020/09/25: For spells with {X} in their mana costs, the copy has the same value of X.
2020/09/25: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. Most notably, the copy is also kicked.
2020/09/25: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2020/09/25: If a permanent spell is copied, it's put onto the battlefield as a token as the spell resolves rather than putting the copy of the spell onto the battlefield. The rules that apply to a permanent spell becoming a permanent apply to a copy of a spell becoming a token.
2020/09/25: The token that a resolving copy of a spell becomes isn't said to have been "created."</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.
2020/09/25: Several cards have a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party. To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: You choose which player or planeswalker Zareth San is attacking. It doesn't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker that the returned Rogue was attacking.
2020/09/25: Although Zareth San is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2020/09/25: Before blockers are declared, attacking Rogues are neither blocked nor unblocked, so you can't pay the cost to activate Zareth San's second ability.
2020/09/25: To activate Zareth San's second ability, you reveal it in your hand. It remains revealed until the ability has resolved.
2020/09/25: If Zareth San leaves your hand before its second ability resolves, the ability does nothing as it resolves. Zareth San remains in its new zone and the Rogue you returned remains in its owner's hand.
2020/09/25: Zareth San's second ability can be activated during the declare blockers step, combat damage step, or end of combat step. If you wait until after the declare blockers step, because all combat damage is dealt at once, Zareth San won't normally deal combat damage.
2020/09/25: If a creature in combat has first strike or double strike, you can activate Zareth San's second ability during the first-strike combat damage step. Zareth San will deal combat damage during the regular combat damage step in this case, even if it somehow gains first strike.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: The source of the copy from Lithoform Engine's first ability is the same as the source of the original ability.
2020/09/25: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have a colon in their reminder text.
2020/09/25: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keywords (such as prowess) are triggered abilities and will use "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
2020/09/25: Lithoform Engine's first ability targets an activated or triggered ability that is on the stack and creates another instance of that ability on the stack. It doesn't cause any object to gain an ability.
2020/09/25: If an ability is linked to a second ability, copies of that first ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by the first ability and the copy. For example, if Fiend Hunter's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied and two creatures are exiled, they both return when Fiend Hunter leaves the battlefield.
2020/09/25: Lithoform Engine can copy any spell or ability on the stack, not just one with targets. If a permanent spell is copied, new targets can't be chosen for it, if it has any (perhaps because it's an Aura or a mutating creature spell).
2020/09/25: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast" or "activated." Creating the copy won't cause abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell or activates an ability to trigger. Abilities that say that a triggered ability triggers additional times won't apply to copying a triggered ability.
2020/09/25: The copy will resolve before the original spell or ability does.
2020/09/25: The copy will have the same targets as the spell or ability it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2020/09/25: If the spell or ability that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen. This doesn't apply to copying a permanent spell with a modal enters-the-battlefield triggered ability, but it does apply to copying that ability.
2020/09/25: If the spell or ability that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast or activated, the copy will have the same value of X.
2020/09/25: If the spell or ability has damage divided as it was put onto the stack, the division can't be changed, although the targets receiving that damage still can. The same is true of spells and abilities that distribute counters.
2020/09/25: You can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. Most notably, if the original spell was kicked, the copy is kicked.
2020/09/25: Any choices made when the spell or ability resolves won't have been made yet when it's copied. Any such choices will be made separately when the copy resolves. Most notably, if a triggered ability asks you to pay a cost (such as that of Leyline Tyrant), you pay that cost for the copy if you wish to have it paid.
2020/09/25: If a permanent spell is copied, it's put onto the battlefield as a token as the spell resolves rather than putting the copy of the spell onto the battlefield. The rules that apply to a permanent spell becoming a permanent apply to a copy of a spell becoming a token.

2020/09/25: If you don't sacrifice Myriad Construct as its last ability resolves (perhaps because its ability triggered more than once and you've already sacrificed it), you still create Construct tokens. The number of tokens you create is determined by Myriad Construct's power as it last existed on the battlefield.
2020/09/25: If a spell targets Myriad Construct more than once, its last ability triggers only once.
2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: To determine "the number of creatures in your party," check whether you control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior, and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only one of those checks.
2020/09/25: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two. You can't choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first as a Cleric.
2020/09/25: An ability referring to the number of creatures in your party gets a number from zero to four. Such abilities never ask which creatures are in your party, and you never have to designate specific creatures as being in your party. You can't choose to exclude creatures from this count to lower the number.
2020/09/25: Several cards have a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party. To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: If a spell has a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in your party, no player may attempt to change that number after you begin to cast the spell but before you pay the cost.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.

In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the mana value of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2020/09/25: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2020/09/25: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.

<Rulings>2020/09/25: There is a single triangle icon in the top left corner of the front face. There is a double triangle icon in the top left corner of the back face.
2020/09/25: To determine whether it is legal to play a modal double-faced card, consider only the characteristics of the face you're playing and ignore the other face's characteristics.
2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a specific modal double-faced card, you may cast it as a spell or play it as a land, as determined by which face you choose to play. If an effect allows you to cast (rather than "play") a specific modal double-faced card, you can't play it as a land.
2020/09/25: If an effect allows you to play a land or cast a spell from among a group of cards, you may play or cast a modal double-faced card with any face that fits the criteria of that effect.
2020/09/25: The converted mana cost of a modal double-faced card is based on the characteristics of the face that's being considered. On the stack and battlefield, consider whichever face is up. In all other zones, consider only the front face. This is different than how the converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced card is determined.
2020/09/25: A modal double-faced card can't be transformed or be put onto the battlefield transformed. Ignore any instruction to transform a modal double-faced card or to put one onto the battlefield transformed.
2020/09/25: If an effect puts a double-faced card onto the battlefield, it enters with its front face up. If that front face can't be put onto the battlefield, it doesn't enter the battlefield.
2020/09/25: If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the name of either face may be chosen. If that effect or a linked ability refers to a spell with the chosen name being cast and/or a land with the chosen name being played, it considers only the chosen name, not the other face's name.
2020/09/25: In the Commander variant, a double-faced card's color identity is determined by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of both faces combined. If either face has a color indicator or basic land type, those are also considered.</Rulings>
