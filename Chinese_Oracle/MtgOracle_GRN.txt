<Rulings>2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>452756</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/10/05: If Conclave Tribunal leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
2018/10/05: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist. When the card returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the card that was exiled.
2018/10/05: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2018/10/05: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2018/10/05: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/10/05: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/10/05: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2018/10/05: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2018/10/05: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Worldsoul Colossus (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{W}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{W}. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay {1}.
2018/10/05: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: Dawn of Hope's first ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Vicious Rumors or 3 life from Creeping Chill.
2018/10/05: You can't pay {2} multiple times to draw more than one card each time you resolve Dawn of Hope's triggered ability.
2018/10/05: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Dawn of Hope's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2018/10/05: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and Dawn of Hope's first ability triggers only once.
2018/10/05: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

(This is because Divine Visitation's effect modifies how the tokens are created, and March of the Machines's effect doesn't apply until you consider how the tokens are entering the battlefield.)
2018/10/05: If an effect changes under whose control a token would be created, that effect applies before Divine Visitation's effect applies. If an effect changes under whose control a token would enter the battlefield, that effect applies after Divine Visitation's effect is able to be applied.</Rulings>

2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

2018/10/05: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2018/10/05: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Worldsoul Colossus (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{W}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{W}. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay {1}.
2018/10/05: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using jump-start only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2018/10/05: A spell cast using jump-start will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
2018/10/05: If an effect allows you to pay an alternative cost rather than a spell's mana cost, you may pay that alternative cost when you jump-start a spell. You'll still discard a card as an additional cost to cast it.
2018/10/05: If a card with jump-start is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: If an effect allows you to pay an alternative cost rather than a spell's mana cost, you may pay that alternative cost when you jump-start a spell. You'll still discard a card as an additional cost to cast it.
2018/10/05: The token copies exactly what is printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2018/10/05: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2018/10/05: If the copied creature is copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature is copying.
2018/10/05: If the copied creature is itself a token, the token created by Quasiduplicate copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
2018/10/05: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2018/10/05: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using jump-start only when you could normally cast a sorcery.

<Rulings>2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

<CardText>Mentor (Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with lesser power.)
At the beginning of combat on your turn, create a 1/1 red Goblin creature token. That token gains haste until end of turn and attacks this combat if able.</CardText>
<Artist>Alex Konstad</Artist>
<Watermark>Boros</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>452859</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/10/05: If the token can't attack for any reason (such as becoming tapped), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2018/10/05: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/10/05: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/10/05: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2018/10/05: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2018/10/05: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Worldsoul Colossus (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{W}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{W}. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay {1}.
2018/10/05: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: To determine if Pelt Collector's first ability triggers when a creature enters the battlefield, use the creature's power after applying any static abilities (such as that of Trostani Discordant) that modify its power.
2018/10/05: To determine if Pelt Collector's first ability triggers when a creature dies, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield.
2018/10/05: If a creature with power less than or equal to Pelt Collector's power enters the battlefield or dies, Pelt Collector's first ability doesn't trigger at all. You can't try to raise that creature's power or lower Pelt Collector's to get a counter.
2018/10/05: As Pelt Collector's first ability resolves, if the entering creature's power is no longer greater than Pelt Collector's power, or if Pelt Collector's power has been raised to greater than or equal to the power of the creature that died, Pelt Collector doesn't get a +1/+1 counter. Notably, this means that if Pelt Collector is still a 1/1 creature and two 2/2 creatures die, it only gets one +1/+1 counter as the first triggered ability resolves, and it will be too big to get a counter as the second triggered ability resolves.
2018/10/05: If the entering creature leaves the battlefield while Pelt Collector's triggered ability is on the stack, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield to determine whether Pelt Collector gets a +1/+1 counter.
2018/10/05: If Pelt Collector's power becomes less than 0, a creature with 0 power (or with power less than 0 but still greater than Pelt Collector's power) entering the battlefield or dying will cause its first ability to trigger.
2018/10/05: If Pelt Collector is dealt lethal damage at the same time as a larger creature you control, they're destroyed at the same time. Pelt Collector won't get an additional +1/+1 from its ability in time to save it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: Aurelia's last ability resolves before attackers are chosen.
2018/10/05: The target creature gains trample and vigilance if it's both red and white. It gets +2/+0 only once, even if it's both red and white, and even if it's neither red nor white.
2018/10/05: Once Aurelia's last ability has resolved, the creature keeps whatever bonuses it got from that ability even if its colors change.
2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: Beacon Bolt is still on the stack while you count your instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard and in exile. It doesn't count itself.
2018/10/05: If any exiled cards you own are face down, they have no characteristics. If they're normally instants or sorceries, they won't be counted.
2018/10/05: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using jump-start only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2018/10/05: A spell cast using jump-start will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
2018/10/05: If an effect allows you to pay an alternative cost rather than a spell's mana cost, you may pay that alternative cost when you jump-start a spell. You'll still discard a card as an additional cost to cast it.
2018/10/05: If a card with jump-start is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: The ability triggers whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets only Beamsplitter Mage and no other object or player, and only if you control another creature that spell could target. If you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has multiple targets and Beamsplitter Mage is chosen as the target in each instance, Beamsplitter Mage's ability will trigger.
2018/10/05: If you don't control another creature the spell could target as Beamsplitter Mage's triggered ability resolves, you don't copy that spell.
2018/10/05: If Beamsplitter Mage leaves the battlefield or becomes an illegal target for the spell that caused its ability to trigger, that spell is still copied.
2018/10/05: If you copy a spell, you control the copy. It will resolve before the original spell does.
2018/10/05: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like Beamsplitter Mage's ability itself) won't trigger.
2018/10/05: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode cannot be chosen.
2018/10/05: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Selective Snare does), the copy has the same value of X.
2018/10/05: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2018/10/05: In some rare cases, the original spell can target another creature but the copy can't (most likely because an effect modified the characteristics of the original spell on the stack and won't modify the copy). If the copy can't target the chosen creature, the copy isn't created.</Rulings>

<CardText>Etrata, the Silencer can't be blocked.
Whenever Etrata deals combat damage to a player, exile target creature that player controls and put a hit counter on that card. That player loses the game if they own three or more exiled cards with hit counters on them. Etrata's owner shuffles Etrata into their library.</CardText>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: If the player controls no creatures, Etrata's ability doesn't resolve. Etrata remains on the battlefield and its owner doesn't shuffle their library. The same is true if the target creature is an illegal target when Etrata's ability tries to resolve.
2018/10/05: If Etrata leaves the battlefield while its triggered ability is on the stack, it remains in its new zone and Etrata's owner shuffles their library.
2018/10/05: If Etrata's ability exiles a token creature, it won't count to determine whether three cards are exiled with hit counters.
2018/10/05: Etrata's owner shuffles it into their library as the triggered ability resolves, regardless of how many cards are in exile or whether the player loses the game.
2018/10/05: In a Commander game, if Etrata is your commander, you may put it into the command zone as its ability resolves. You'll still shuffle your library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

2018/10/05: If a card in your graveyard has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.

2018/10/05: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2018/10/05: If you copy a spell, you control the copy. It will resolve before the original spell does.
2018/10/05: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2018/10/05: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2018/10/05: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Banefire does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2018/10/05: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.

2021/03/19: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated. Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or mana value.
2021/03/19: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.
2021/03/19: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: If an effect allows you to cast Molderhulk from your graveyard, its undergrowth ability doesn't count itself. It's already on the stack when you determine the total cost to cast it.
2018/10/05: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as Molderhulk's undergrowth ability). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/10/05: Creature cards with other types, such as artifact creature cards, count for undergrowth abilities.
2018/10/05: Because tokens aren't cards, they never count for undergrowth abilities.</Rulings>

If there's a cost associated with having a creature block Ochran Assassin, the defending player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to block in that case either.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2018/10/05: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/10/05: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/10/05: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2018/10/05: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2018/10/05: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Worldsoul Colossus (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{W}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{W}. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay {1}.
2018/10/05: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: The owner of a token is the player who created it.
2018/10/05: Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to other creatures you control may become lethal if Trostani leaves the battlefield during that turn.
2018/10/05: If a creature has an ability that triggers at the beginning of each end step and Trostani's ability causes you to gain control of it, the ability of that creature is still controlled by the creature's former controller. If the creature has an ability that triggers at the beginning of your end step, that ability doesn't trigger when you gain control of it.</Rulings>

Whenever Truefire Captain is dealt damage, it deals that much damage to target player.</CardText>
<Artist>Chris Rallis</Artist>
<Watermark>Boros</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>452959</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/10/05: Truefire Captain's last ability will trigger even if it is dealt lethal damage. For example, if it's dealt damage by a 7/7 creature it's blocking, its ability will trigger and Truefire Captain will deal 7 damage to the target player.
2018/10/05: If your life total is brought to 0 or less at the same time that Truefire Captain is dealt damage, you lose the game before its triggered ability goes on the stack.
2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

As long as the fighting creature you control has power greater than 0 (and the damage isn't prevented), the fighting creature you don't control will be destroyed.
2018/10/05: If one of the two target creatures is an illegal target by the time Undercity Uprising tries to resolve, no creature deals or is dealt damage. Creatures you control still gain deathtouch.

<Multiverseid>452965</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/10/05: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2018/10/05: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/10/05: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/10/05: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2018/10/05: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2018/10/05: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Worldsoul Colossus (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{W}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{W}. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay {1}.
2018/10/05: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

2018/10/05: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2018/10/05: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Banefire does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2018/10/05: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2018/10/05: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2018/10/05: If you copy a spell, you control the copy. It will resolve before the original spell does.
2018/10/05: If one of Explosion's two targets becomes illegal, the other is affected as appropriate.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: If the target creature becomes an illegal target for Vraska's Stoneglare, the spell doesn't resolve. You don't gain life or search for Vraska, Regal Gorgon.
2018/10/05: The amount of life gained is equal to the destroyed creature's toughness as it last existed on the battlefield. If it wasn't destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), you gain life equal to its toughness as it currently exists on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2018/10/05: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/10/05: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/10/05: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2018/10/05: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2018/10/05: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Worldsoul Colossus (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{W}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{W}. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay {1}.
2018/10/05: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>
