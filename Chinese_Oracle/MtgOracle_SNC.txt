<Rulings>2022/04/29: Once an ability that causes a creature to connive begins to resolve, no player may take any other actions until it's done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the conniving creature after you discard a nonland card but before it receives a counter.
2022/04/29: If no card is discarded, most likely because that player's hand is empty and an effect says they can't draw cards, the conniving creature does not receive a +1/+1 counter.
2022/04/29: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to connive but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still connives. If you discard a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything. Abilities that trigger "when [that creature] connives" will trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: Use Body Launderer's power as it last existed on the battlefield to determine legal targets for its last ability.
2022/04/29: Once an ability that causes a creature to connive begins to resolve, no player may take any other actions until it's done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the conniving creature after you discard a nonland card but before it receives a counter.
2022/04/29: If no card is discarded, most likely because that player's hand is empty and an effect says they can't draw cards, the conniving creature does not receive a +1/+1 counter.
2022/04/29: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to connive but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still connives. If you discard a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything. Abilities that trigger "when [that creature] connives" will trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: The game checks whether it is legal to cast a spell before costs are determined or mana abilities are activated while casting it. If cards are removed from your graveyard after that point, such as by exiling Jack-o'-Lantern from your graveyard to pay for its mana ability, this won't affect whether you can legally cast Graveyard Shift, even if that reduces the number of mana values in your graveyard to below five.
2022/04/29: If an effect allows you to cast Graveyard Shift from your graveyard, you may cast it any time you could cast an instant if you have five or more mana values among cards in your graveyard immediately before you begin to cast it, even if moving it to the stack would reduce that number to four.
2022/04/29: "Five or more mana values among cards in your graveyard" means there are at least five mana values among those cards.

<Rulings>2022/04/29: If you choose to pay the blitz cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its blitz cost only if you could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2022/04/29: If you pay the blitz cost to cast a creature spell, that permanent will be sacrificed only if it's still on the battlefield when that triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2022/04/29: You don't have to attack with the creature with blitz unless another ability says you do.
2022/04/29: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose blitz cost was paid, the copy won't have haste, won't be sacrificed, and its controller won't draw a card when it dies.

<Rulings>2022/04/29: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless it's copying a creature that's a token or that's copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether the creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Most notably, if the target creature isn't normally a creature, the copy won't be a creature.
2022/04/29: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2022/04/29: If a copied creature is copying something else, the token you create will use the copiable values of the target creature. In most cases, it will just be a copy of whatever that creature is copying.
2022/04/29: If a copied creature is a token that isn't a copy of something else, the copy copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
2022/04/29: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature card will also work.
2022/04/29: If another creature becomes a copy of, or enters the battlefield as a copy of, the token, that creature will copy the creature card the token is copying. However, it won't have either haste or "When this creature dies, draw a card," and you won't sacrifice the new copy at the beginning of the next end step.
2022/04/29: If Jaxis, the Troublemaker's ability creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (such as the one Doubling Season creates), you'll sacrifice each of them at the beginning of the next end step.
2022/04/29: If you choose to pay the blitz cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its blitz cost only if you could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2022/04/29: If you pay the blitz cost to cast a creature spell, that permanent will be sacrificed only if it's still on the battlefield when that triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2022/04/29: You don't have to attack with the creature with blitz unless another ability says you do.
2022/04/29: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose blitz cost was paid, the copy won't have haste, won't be sacrificed, and its controller won't draw a card when it dies.
2022/04/29: The triggered ability that lets its controller draw a card triggers when it dies for any reason, not just when you sacrifice it during the end step.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: Evolving Door's ability instructs you to count the number of colors, but it doesn't track what those colors were. For example, if you sacrifice a creature that is green and no other colors, you'll search for any creature card that is exactly two colors, even if the card you search for isn't green.
2022/04/29: If you sacrifice a colorless creature, you must search your library for a creature card with exactly one color. If you sacrifice a creature that is all five colors, you won't be able to find any creatures because there are no creature cards in Magic with six colors.
2022/04/29: You must pay all costs for a spell you cast this way.
2022/04/29: If you choose to cast the spell, you must cast it as Evolving Door's ability resolves. You cannot wait and cast it later.
2022/04/29: You count the colors of the sacrificed creature as it last existed on the battlefield. Notably, if it was a double-faced card or a copy of another creature, that may be different from what its colors are in the graveyard.</Rulings>

2022/04/29: Any player who has controlled a permanent with a hideaway ability since a card was exiled with it may look at that card.
2022/04/29: Previously, permanents with hideaway entered the battlefield tapped. This ability has been removed from the definition of hideaway. Older cards have received errata to have an additional paragraph that reads "[This permanent] enters the battlefield tapped," and they now have hideaway 4.

2022/04/29: Shield counters don't prevent players from sacrificing creatures.
2022/04/29: Removing a shield counter in this way isn't the same as regenerating a creature.
2022/04/29: If a permanent that would be dealt damage has more than one shield counter on it, that damage is prevented and only one shield counter is removed.
2022/04/29: If a permanent with a shield counter is dealt unpreventable damage, that damage will be dealt and a shield counter will still be removed.
2022/04/29: A creature with a shield counter on it may still be destroyed by state-based actions if it has damage marked on it equal to its toughness or has been dealt unpreventable damage by a source with deathtouch.
2022/04/29: "Shield" is not an ability that creatures have and shield counters are not keyword counters. If a creature with a shield counter loses its abilities, the shield counter will still protect it as normal.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: If you choose to pay the blitz cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its blitz cost only if you could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2022/04/29: If you pay the blitz cost to cast a creature spell, that permanent will be sacrificed only if it's still on the battlefield when that triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2022/04/29: You don't have to attack with the creature with blitz unless another ability says you do.
2022/04/29: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose blitz cost was paid, the copy won't have haste, won't be sacrificed, and its controller won't draw a card when it dies.

2022/04/29: Removing a shield counter in this way isn't the same as regenerating a creature.
2022/04/29: If a permanent that would be dealt damage has more than one shield counter on it, that damage is prevented and only one shield counter is removed.
2022/04/29: If a permanent with a shield counter is dealt unpreventable damage, that damage will be dealt and a shield counter will still be removed.
2022/04/29: A creature with a shield counter on it may still be destroyed by state-based actions if it has damage marked on it equal to its toughness or has been dealt unpreventable damage by a source with deathtouch.
2022/04/29: "Shield" is not an ability that creatures have and shield counters are not keyword counters. If a creature with a shield counter loses its abilities, the shield counter will still protect it as normal.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: As you cast a spell with casualty X, you choose whether to pay its casualty cost and what the value of X will be.
2022/04/29: The copied spell from Ob Nixilis, the Adversary's triggered ability copies exactly what is printed on Ob Nixilis, except its starting loyalty is equal to the chosen value of X and it isn't legendary. The copy becomes a token as it resolves.
2022/04/29: You can control exactly one legendary Ob Nixilis, the Adversary and any number of nonlegendary copies of Ob Nixilis, the Adversary.
2022/04/29: Casualty N means "As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may sacrifice a creature with power N or greater." and "When you cast this spell, if a casualty cost was paid for it, copy it. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for the copy."
2022/04/29: You may sacrifice only one creature to pay a spell's casualty cost, and you copy the spell only once.
2022/04/29: If you pay the casualty cost of a spell, the copy will resolve before the original spell.
2022/04/29: The copy of the spell is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: Once an ability that causes a creature to connive begins to resolve, no player may take any other actions until it's done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the conniving creature after you discard a nonland card but before it receives a counter.
2022/04/29: If no card is discarded, most likely because that player's hand is empty and an effect says they can't draw cards, the conniving creature does not receive a +1/+1 counter.
2022/04/29: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to connive but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still connives. If you discard a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything. Abilities that trigger "when [that creature] connives" will trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: "If you don't" in the second ability refers to whether you played a land or cast a spell from the top of your library, not just whether or not you cast a spell.
2022/04/29: If you choose to pay the blitz cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its blitz cost only if you could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2022/04/29: If you pay the blitz cost to cast a creature spell, that permanent will be sacrificed only if it's still on the battlefield when that triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2022/04/29: You don't have to attack with the creature with blitz unless another ability says you do.
2022/04/29: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose blitz cost was paid, the copy won't have haste, won't be sacrificed, and its controller won't draw a card when it dies.
2022/04/29: The triggered ability that lets its controller draw a card triggers when it dies for any reason, not just when you sacrifice it during the end step.</Rulings>
