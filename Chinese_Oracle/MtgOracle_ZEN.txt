Enchanted creature gets +3/+3.
Whenever enchanted creature deals combat damage to a player, double its controller's life total.</CardText>

<ChineseFlavor>有了此铠甲，就连高山也无需畏惧。</ChineseFlavor>
<Artist>Steve Argyle</Artist>
<Multiverseid>198524</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: At the time the ability triggers, determine which creature Celestial Mantle is enchanting. As the ability resolves, determine who currently controls that creature (or, if it's no longer on the battlefield, determine who controlled it when it left). That's the player whose life total is doubled. It doesn't matter who controls Celestial Mantle, who controlled the creature at the time the ability triggered, or what creature Celestial Mantle enchants at the time the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: If a creature dealing combat damage at the same time as the enchanted creature has lifelink, the life gained due to lifelink happens before Celestial Mantle's triggered ability resolves.
2009/10/01: If the enchanted creature's controller has a life total below 0 (which is possible if that player controls Platinum Angel, for example), Celestial Mantle's triggered ability multiplies that number by two. For example, if the player had -4 life, that player's life total becomes -8.
2009/10/01: If a player's life total is doubled, that player actually gains or loses the necessary amount of life. For example, if the life total of the enchanted creature's controller is 14 when Celestial Mantle's triggered ability resolves, the ability causes that player to gain 14 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Celestial Mantle's essentially doubles the team's life total. Specifically, the triggered ability will affect one player's life total, and then the team's life total is adjusted by the amount of life the player gains as a result of this ability. Suppose a creature enchanted by Celestial Mantle deals combat damage to an opponent, and that creature's controller's team has 11 life. That player then has 11 life, so it's doubled to 22, for a net gain of 11 life. The team's life total becomes 22 (11 + 11).</Rulings>

2018/03/16: You can activate Luminarch Ascension's last ability during the end step in which it receives its fourth quest counter.
2018/03/16: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Luminarch Ascension's first ability will trigger twice at the beginning of the opposing team's end step if you didn't lose life that turn. It doesn't matter whether your teammate lost life or not.</Rulings>

Process the draws one at a time. Even if you use the reasonable shortcut of finding all of the cards at once and only physically shuffling once, the game will consider you to have searched and shuffled once per card.
2009/10/01: If a spell or ability causes you to put cards in your hand without specifically using the word "draw," Archmage Ascension's abilities ignore it.
2009/10/01: If two or more replacement effects would apply to a card-drawing event, the player who's drawing the card chooses what order to apply them. It's possible that after applying one of them, the others will no longer be applicable because the player would no longer draw a card. For example, if you control more than one Archmage Ascension with six quest counters on it and you would draw a card, each Archmage Ascension's replacement effect could apply. Once you use one, the rest are no longer applicable.</Rulings>

2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If the target nonland permanent is an illegal target by the time Into the Roil tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card if it was kicked.
2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: You may target a creature you already control with Roil Elemental's ability. This will usually have no visible effect, but it will overwrite any previous control-change effects. For example, if you gain control of Roil Elemental until the end of the turn (with Mark of Mutiny, perhaps), then its landfall ability triggers and you target Roil Elemental itself, you'll gain control of it indefinitely (since its control-change effect will last for as long as you control it).</Rulings>

<Artist>Adi Granov</Artist>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: Bloodchief Ascension's first ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." It won't trigger at all unless an opponent has already lost 2 or more life by the time the end step begins.
2009/10/01: Bloodchief Ascension's first ability checks how much life was lost by each opponent over the course of the entire turn, even if Bloodchief Ascension wasn't on the battlefield the whole time.
2009/10/01: For the first ability to trigger, a single opponent must have lost 2 life. Two opponents each losing 1 life won't cause it to trigger. It will trigger a maximum of once per turn, no matter how many opponents have lost 2 or more life.
2009/10/01: Bloodchief Ascension's first ability checks only whether life was lost. It doesn't care whether life was also gained. For example, if an opponent lost 4 life and gained 6 life during the turn, that player will have a higher life total than they started the turn with — but Bloodchief Ascension's first ability will still trigger.
2009/10/01: Bloodchief Ascension's second ability doesn't behave like a leaves-the-battlefield triggered ability, since the card put into an opponent's graveyard may come from anywhere. If a Bloodchief Ascension with three quest counters on it and a permanent an opponent owns are destroyed at the same time, for example, the game will not "look back in time" at the game state, and Bloodchief Ascension's second ability won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: Intimidate looks at the current colors of a creature that has it. Normally, Halo Hunter can't be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or black creatures. If it's turned white, then it can't be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or white creatures.
2009/10/01: If an attacking creature has intimidate, what colors it is matters only as the defending player declares blockers. Once it's blocked, changing its colors won't change that.
2009/10/01: Halo Hunter's triggered ability isn't optional. When it enters the battlefield, if you're the only player that controls an Angel, you'll have to target an Angel you control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: You may ignore a Trap's alternative cost condition and simply cast it for its normal mana cost. This is true even if its alternative cost condition has been met.
2009/10/01: Casting a Trap by paying its alternative cost doesn't change its mana cost or converted mana cost. The only difference is the cost you actually pay.
2009/10/01: Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast a Trap will apply to whichever cost you chose to pay.
2009/10/01: Needlebite Trap's alternative cost condition checks only whether life was gained. It doesn't care whether life was also lost. For example, if an opponent gained 4 life and lost 6 life during the turn, that player will have a lower life total than they started the turn with — but you can still cast Needlebite Trap by paying {B}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: The player who is being controlled is still the active player.
2009/10/01: While controlling another player, you also continue to make your own choices and decisions.
2009/10/01: While controlling another player, you make all choices and decisions that player is allowed to make or is told to make during that turn. For example: -- You choose which lands the other player plays. -- You choose which spells the other player casts, and make all decisions as those spells are cast and as they resolve. For example, you choose the value of X for that player's Earthquake, the target for that player's Lightning Bolt, what mana that player spends to cast Day of Judgment, and what card that player gets with Diabolic Tutor. -- You choose which activated abilities the other player activates, and make all decisions as those abilities are activated and as they resolve. For example, you can have your opponent sacrifice their creatures to their Vampire Aristocrat or have your opponent's Caller of Gales give one of your creatures flying. -- You make all decisions for the other player's triggered abilities, including what they target and any decisions made when they resolve. -- You choose which creatures controlled by the other player attack, who or what they attack, and how they assign their combat damage. -- You make any choices and decisions that player would make for any other reason. For example, you could cast Fact or Fiction, choose that player to divide the revealed cards into piles, and thus divide those cards into piles yourself.
2009/10/01: You can't make the affected player concede. That player may choose to concede at any time, even while you're controlling their turn.
2009/10/01: You can't make any illegal decisions or illegal choices — you can't do anything that player couldn't do. You can't make choices or decisions for that player that aren't called for by the game rules or by any cards, permanents, spells, abilities, and so on. If an effect causes another player to make decisions that the affected player would normally make (such as Master Warcraft does), that effect takes precedence. (In other words, if the affected player wouldn't make a decision, you wouldn't make that decision on their behalf.) You also can't make any choices or decisions for the player that would be called for by the tournament rules (such as whether to take an intentional draw or whether to call a judge).
2009/10/01: If the targeted permanent or player is an illegal target by the time Sorin's first ability resolves, the entire ability doesn't resolve. You won't gain life.
2009/10/01: You only control the player. You don't control any of the other player's permanents, spells, or abilities.
2009/10/01: If the player affected by Sorin's third ability skips their next turn, the ability will wait. You'll control the next turn the affected player actually takes.
2009/10/01: Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.
2009/10/01: You could gain control of yourself using Sorin's third ability, but unless you do so to overwrite someone else's player-controlling effect, this doesn't do anything.
2009/10/01: You can use only the affected player's resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player; you can't use your own. Similarly, you can use the affected player's resources only to pay that player's costs; you can't spend them on your costs.
2009/10/01: For a player's life total to become 10, what actually happens is that the player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if the targeted opponent's life total is 4 when this ability resolves, it will cause that player to gain 6 life; alternately, if the targeted player's life total is 17 when this ability resolves, it will cause that player to lose 7 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2009/10/01: Sorin's third ability allows you to control another player. This effect applies to the next turn that the affected player actually takes.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Sorin's second ability causes the targeted opponent's team's life total to become 10. Only the targeted player is actually considered to have actually gained or lost life.
2016/07/13: While controlling another player, you can see all cards in the game that player can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, and any cards in that player's library the player may look at.
2016/07/13: Controlling a player doesn't allow you to look at that player's sideboard. If an effect instructs that player to choose a card from outside the game, you can't have that player choose any card.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: If an attacking creature has intimidate, what colors it is matters only as the defending player declares blockers. Once it's blocked, changing its colors won't change that.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steve Argyle</Artist>
<Multiverseid>195402</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: If you activate Chandra Ablaze's first ability, you don't discard a card until the ability resolves. You may activate the ability even if your hand is empty. You choose a target as you activate the ability even if you have no red cards in hand at that time.
2009/10/01: As the first ability resolves, nothing happens if your hand is empty. But if you have any cards in hand, you must discard one. If you discard a nonred card, Chandra doesn't deal any damage.
2009/10/01: If the creature targeted by the first ability is an illegal target by the time it resolves, the entire ability doesn't resolve. You won't discard a card.
2009/10/01: You may activate Chandra's second ability even if your hand is empty. As it resolves, a player whose hand is empty simply draws three cards.
2009/10/01: You cast red instant cards and red sorcery cards from your graveyard as part of the resolution of Chandra Ablaze's third ability. You don't choose which ones to cast until you're actually doing so as the ability resolves. You cast only the ones you want to, and you may cast them in any order. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat"). Each card you cast this way is put on the stack, then the ability finishes resolving. Those spells will then resolve as normal, one at a time, in the opposite order that they were put on the stack. They'll go back to the graveyard as they resolve.
2009/10/01: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: You target a permanent or player when the ability triggers. You decide whether or not to pay {2}{R} as the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: Once you decide to pay {2}{R}, it's too late for anyone to respond (such as by activating a regeneration ability the targeted creature has).
2009/10/01: If you pay {2}{R}, the creature that entered the battlefield deals damage equal to its current power to the targeted permanent or player. If it's no longer on the battlefield, its last known existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its power.
2009/10/01: Electropotence is the source of the ability, but the creature is the source of the damage. The ability couldn't target a creature with protection from red, for example. It could target a creature with protection from creatures, but all the damage would be prevented. Since damage is dealt by the creature, lifelink, deathtouch, and wither are taken into account, even if the creature has left the battlefield by the time it deals damage.</Rulings>

<CardText>{1}{R}{R}: Put a blaze counter on target land without a blaze counter on it. For as long as that land has a blaze counter on it, it has "At the beginning of your upkeep, this land deals 1 damage to you."

<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Multiverseid>192224</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: As the reminder text indicates, whether the targeted land has the triggered ability that's been granted to it depends only on whether it has a blaze counter on it, not on whether Obsidian Fireheart is still on the battlefield.
2009/10/01: The ability gained by the land triggers at the beginning of the upkeep of the land's controller, not the beginning of the upkeep of Obsidian Fireheart's controller. The player who controls the land at the time the ability triggers is the one who's dealt damage.
2009/10/01: A land with a blaze counter on it is an illegal target for this ability. You may activate the ability targeting a land, then activate the ability in response to itself targeting the same land. Although the first ability to resolve will put a blaze counter on that land, the second ability to resolve won't resolve.
2009/10/01: If all blaze counters on a land are moved to a different land, the triggered ability doesn't follow them. The first land no longer has the ability because it no longer has a blaze counter on it. The second land doesn't have the ability because Obsidian Fireheart didn't target it.
2009/10/01: If a land ends up with more than one blaze counter on it (thanks to Doubling Season or Gilder Bairn, for example), the ability still only causes it to deal 1 damage to its controller each turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>
<Multiverseid>192217</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: Punishing Fire's triggered ability triggers only if it's already in your graveyard at the time an opponent gains life. For example, you can cast it in response to a spell or ability that will cause an opponent to gain life. In that case, Punishing Fire will resolve first, so it will be in the graveyard by the time the opponent gains life. However, if you wait until an opponent actually gains life and then cast Punishing Fire, you won't be able to return it to your hand at that time.
2009/10/01: You choose whether to pay {R} as the triggered ability resolves.
2009/10/01: If Punishing Fire has left your graveyard by the time its triggered ability resolves, you may still pay {R}, but you won't return it to your hand. This is true even if Punishing Fire has left your graveyard and returned to it by the time its triggered ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>197891</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: If either of Pyromancer Ascension's abilities triggers, it will go on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. The ability will resolve first. If it's Pyromancer Ascension's second ability that triggered, the copy it creates will also resolve before the original spell. The copy is created even if the original spell has been countered.
2017/03/14: If Pyromancer Ascension's first ability triggers, you'll put a quest counter on it even if the card in your graveyard leaves your graveyard by the time the ability resolves or if the spell you cast is countered.
2017/03/14: If you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your graveyard (due to an ability such as flashback, for example), Pyromancer Ascension's first ability won't trigger unless another card with the same name is in your graveyard.
2017/03/14: The second ability triggers only if Pyromancer Ascension already has two quest counters on it at the time you cast an instant or sorcery spell. This means a spell can't cause the second counter to be put on Pyromancer Ascension and then become copied. It also means a player can't remove Pyromancer Ascension in response to you casting an instant or sorcery spell in order to prevent the ability from triggering.
2017/03/14: Pyromancer Ascension's second ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2017/03/14: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2017/03/14: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode cannot be chosen.
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Bonfire of the Damned does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2017/03/14: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fiery Justice does), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2017/03/14: You can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever a source you control deals damage to an opponent, you may put a quest counter on Quest for Pure Flame.
Remove four quest counters from Quest for Pure Flame and sacrifice it: If any source you control would deal damage to a permanent or player this turn, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Cyril Van Der Haegen</Artist>
<Multiverseid>197407</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: The second ability affects all sources you control that would deal damage to a permanent or player at any point in the rest of the turn.
2009/10/01: Both of Quest for Pure Flame's abilities interact with any kind of damage, not just combat damage.
2009/10/01: The source of combat damage is the creature that dealt it.
2009/10/01: If a spell causes damage to be dealt, that spell will always identify the source of the damage. In most cases, the source is the spell itself. For example, Lightning Bolt says "Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target."
2009/10/01: If an ability causes damage to be dealt, that ability will always identify the source of the damage. The ability itself is never the source. However, the source of the ability is often the source of the damage. For example, Prodigal Pyromancer's ability says "Prodigal Pyromancer deals 1 damage to any target."
2009/10/01: If the source of the damage is a permanent, Quest for Pure Flame checks whether you control that permanent at the time that damage is dealt. If the permanent has left the battlefield by then, its last known information is used. If the source of the damage is a spell, whether you control it is obvious. If the source of the damage is a card in some other zone (such as a cycled Jund Sojourners), Quest for Pure Flame checks whether you're the card's owner, rather than whether you're its controller.
2009/10/01: When the first ability resolves, you may put just one quest counter on Quest for Pure Flame. It doesn't matter how much damage the source dealt.
2009/10/01: The first ability will trigger multiple times if multiple sources you control deal damage to a single opponent at once, or if a single source you control deals damage to multiple opponents at once.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would be dealt damage or the controller of the creature that would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target." Suppose a spell controlled by a player who has activated Quest for Pure Fire's second ability would deal 5 damage to a player who has cast Mending Hands targeting themselves. The player who would be dealt damage can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let Quest for Pure Fire's effect double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage.
2009/10/01: If a spell or ability divides damage among multiple recipients (such as Arrow Volley Trap does), the damage is divided before Quest for Pure Fire's effect doubles it. The same is true for combat damage.
2009/10/01: If you activate the second ability of more than one Quest for Pure Flame in the same turn, the effects are cumulative. Two such effects will cause damage from sources you control to be multiplied by four; three such effects will cause damage from sources you control to be multiplied by eight.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: You may ignore a Trap's alternative cost condition and simply cast it for its normal mana cost. This is true even if its alternative cost condition has been met.
2009/10/01: Casting a Trap by paying its alternative cost doesn't change its mana cost or mana value. The only difference is the cost you actually pay.
2009/10/01: Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast a Trap will apply to whichever cost you chose to pay.
2009/10/01: A spell or ability destroys a permanent only if that spell or ability specifically contains the word "destroy" in its text. If a spell or ability an opponent controls exiles a noncreature permanent you control, causes you to sacrifice a noncreature permanent, removes all loyalty counters from a planeswalker you control, or causes an ability you control to trigger (and then that ability destroys a permanent you control), Cobra Trap's alternative cost condition hasn't been met.</Rulings>

Enchant creature
Enchanted creature has base power and toughness 8/8 and has trample.

<Artist>Justin Sweet</Artist>
<Multiverseid>195627</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: If the creature targeted by the Gigantiform spell is an illegal target by the time Gigantiform resolves, the spell doesn't resolve. It won't enter the battlefield, so you won't get to search your library for another Gigantiform.
2009/10/01: Gigantiform overwrites all previous effects that set the enchanted creature's power and toughness to specific values. Other effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after Gigantiform becomes attached to it will overwrite Gigantiform.
2009/10/01: Effects that modify the enchanted creature's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2009/10/01: Although the Gigantiform cast as a spell targets a creature, the Gigantiform put onto the battlefield as a result of the first one's triggered ability does not. It may be attached to a creature with shroud, for example. However, it may not be attached to a creature that couldn't be enchanted by it, such as a creature with protection from green. You don't choose which creature it will be attached to until it enters the battlefield. Once you choose which creature to attach it to, it's too late for players to respond.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Deciding to have the targeted creature block doesn't force you to attack with Turntimber Basilisk that turn. If Turntimber Basilisk doesn't attack, the targeted creature is free to block whichever creature its controller chooses, or block no creatures at all.
2009/10/01: If you choose to have the targeted creature block but that creature isn't able to block Turntimber Basilisk (for example, because the targeted creature can block only creatures with flying), the requirement to block does nothing. The targeted creature is free to block whichever creature its controller chooses, or block no creatures at all.
2009/10/01: Tapped creatures, creatures that can't block as the result of an effect, creatures with unpaid costs to block (such as those from War Cadence), and creatures that aren't controlled by the defending player are exempt from effects that would require them to block. Such creatures can be targeted by Turntimber Basilisk's landfall ability, but the requirement to block does nothing.

<Artist>John Avon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>189006</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2009/10/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.
2009/10/01: Eternity Vessel's landfall ability cares only about how many charge counters are on it, not what its controller's life total was as it entered the battlefield. The number of charge counters may be changed by other spells and abilities.
2009/10/01: For your life total to become the number of charge counters on Eternity Vessel, you actually gain or lose the necessary amount of life. For example, if your life total is 4 when Eternity Vessel's landfall ability resolves and Eternity Vessel has 12 charge counters on it, the ability will cause you to gain 8 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, your life total is the same as your team's life total, so Eternity Vessel enters the battlefield with a number of charge counters on it equal to your team's life total. When its landfall ability resolves, it causes its controller to lose or gain the appropriate amount of life, and the team's life total is adjusted by the amount of life the player gains or loses as a result of this ability. Suppose Eternity Vessel has 15 charge counters on it when its landfall ability resolves, and its controller's team has 11 life. That player's life total is 11, which becomes 15, for a net gain of 4 life. The team's life total becomes 15.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: If you control the triggered ability, you decide whether to have the targeted creature block the attacking creature at the time the ability resolves, not at the time blockers are declared.
2009/10/01: If you choose to have the targeted creature block, the creature it must block is the one that was equipped by Grappling Hook at the time the ability triggered. It doesn't matter if Grappling Hook leaves the battlefield or somehow becomes attached to another creature.
2009/10/01: If you choose to have the targeted creature block the creature that was equipped with Grappling Hook, but it isn't able to do so as blockers are declared (for example, because the attacking creature has flying and the targeted creature doesn't), the requirement to block does nothing. The targeted creature is free to block whichever creature its controller chooses, or block no creatures at all.
2009/10/01: Tapped creatures, creatures that can't block as the result of an effect, creatures with unpaid costs to block (such as those from War Cadence), and creatures that aren't controlled by the defending player are exempt from effects that would require them to block. Such creatures can be targeted by the ability, but the requirement to block does nothing.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2009/10/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.</Rulings>
