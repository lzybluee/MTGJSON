<Rulings>2014/05/29: You must turn Double Stroke face up before you cast the spell with the chosen name to have Double Stroke's second ability trigger.
2014/05/29: When the ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2014/05/29: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2014/05/29: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2014/05/29: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Skeletal Scrying has), the copy will have the same value of X.
2014/05/29: Effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell will be copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. For example, if a player exiles three cards from their graveyard to cast Skeletal Scrying, and you copy it, the copy will also cause you to draw three cards and lose 3 life (but you won't exile any cards from your graveyard).
2016/08/23: At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players. Notably, you can't bluff conspiracies with hidden agenda by putting other cards into the command zone face down as the game starts.

<Rulings>2016/08/23: Conspiracies are never put into your deck. Instead, you put any number of conspiracies from your card pool into the command zone as the game begins. These conspiracies are face up unless they have hidden agenda, in which case they begin the game face down.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy doesn't count as a card in your deck for purposes of meeting minimum deck size requirements. (In most drafts, the minimum deck size is 40 cards.)
2016/08/23: You don't have to play with any conspiracy you draft. However, you have only one opportunity to put conspiracies into the command zone, as the game begins. You can't put conspiracies into the command zone after this point.
2016/08/23: You can look at any player's face-up conspiracies at any time. You'll also know how many face-down conspiracies a player has in the command zone, although you won't know what they are.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy's static and triggered abilities function as long as that conspiracy is face-up in the command zone.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are colorless, have no mana cost, and can't be cast as spells.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies aren't legal for any sanctioned Constructed format, but may be included in other Limited formats, such as Cube Draft.
2016/08/23: You name the card as the game begins, as you put the conspiracy into the command zone, not as you turn the face-down conspiracy face up.
2016/08/23: There are several ways to secretly name a card, including writing the name on a piece of paper that's kept with the face-down conspiracy. If you have multiple face-down conspiracies, you may name a different card for each one. It's important that each named card is clearly associated with only one of the conspiracies.
2016/08/23: You must name a Magic card. Notably, you can't name a token (except in the unusual case that a token's name matches the name of a card, such as Illusion).
2016/08/23: If you play multiple games after the draft, you can name a different card in each new game.
2016/08/23: As a special action, you may turn a face-down conspiracy face up. You may do so any time you have priority. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Once face up, the named card is revealed and the conspiracy's abilities will affect the game.

<Rulings>2014/05/29: The vote happens as the ability resolves. Until this happens, Council Guardian doesn't have protection from any color.

2014/05/29: Because the votes are cast in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.

2014/05/29: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Skeletal Scrying has), the copy will have the same value of X.
2014/05/29: Effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell will be copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. For example, if a player exiles three cards from their graveyard to cast Skeletal Scrying, and you copy it, the copy will also cause you to draw three cards and lose 3 life (but you won't exile any cards from your graveyard).
2014/05/29: Because the votes are cast in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.

2014/05/29: Players can't do anything after they finishing voting but before the spell or ability that included the vote finishes resolving.
2014/05/29: The phrase "the vote is tied" refers only to when there is more than one choice that received the most votes. For example, if a 5-player vote from among three different choices ends 3 votes to 1 vote to 1 vote, the vote isn't tied.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/05/29: Haste and dethrone are part of the copiable values of Dack's Duplicate. If another creature enters the battlefield as or becomes a copy of Dack's Duplicate, it will copy whatever Dack's Duplicate is copying and have haste and dethrone.
2014/05/29: The ability of Dack's Duplicate doesn't target the creature.
2014/05/29: Dack's Duplicate copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below), except it will have haste and dethrone. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2014/05/29: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Grenzo, Dungeon Warden), X is considered to be 0.
2014/05/29: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Dack's Duplicate), then Dack's Duplicate enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying. It will have haste and dethrone.
2014/05/29: If the chosen creature is a token, Dack's Duplicate copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Dack's Duplicate is not a token, even when copying one.
2014/05/29: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Dack's Duplicate enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.

2014/05/29: If either card involved in the exchange has any information noted for it, that information stays with the exchanged card, not the player who initially drafted it. Any abilities that refer to actions taken as you drafted the card (or similar) now refer to the card's new owner, even though that player wasn't the person who actually drafted the card.
2014/05/29: If a player exchanges a card that has multiple pieces of information noted for it, all of the information is shared during the exchange. For example, if you receive a Cogwork Tracker from a player who drafted multiple Cogwork Trackers, your Cogwork Trackers may attack any player noted by either you or the other player for Cogwork Tracker. The other player will not remove a noted player from their remaining Cogwork Tracker.
2014/05/29: If more than one player drafts a Deal Broker, players who wish to use the second ability to exchange cards do so in a random order.
2014/05/29: If your draft is breaking up into multiple games, the exchange happens before it's known who will be playing in each game.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/05/29: The booster pack can be from any Magic: The Gathering set, but you must provide it. Consult your co-conspirators for guidance.
2014/05/29: To add a booster pack to the draft, first pass the booster pack that contained Lore Seeker to the next player. Then open the new booster pack, draft a card, and pass the new booster pack in the same direction. Then you'll receive the booster pack you would've received had you not added a booster pack, and the draft round will continue. The added booster pack will last a few picks longer than the rest of the booster packs opened that draft round.
2014/05/29: Adding a booster pack to a draft may cause some players to have more cards in their card pools than others. This is normal.
2014/05/29: If you use Agent of Acquisitions to draft a booster pack containing Lore Seeker, and you wish to add a booster pack to the draft, first draft each remaining card from the Lore Seeker booster pack. Then open the new booster pack. You may look at the cards in that pack, but you can't draft any cards from it. You'll pass the new booster pack as normal. That was very generous of you.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: The enchanted permanent will be both a land and a creature and can be affected by anything that affects either a land or a creature.
2010/03/01: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/03/01: An attacking or blocking creature that stops being a creature is removed from combat. This can happen if a Zendikon enchanting an attacking or blocking creature leaves the battlefield, for example. The permanent that was removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt combat damage. Any attacking creature that the land creature was blocking remains blocked, however.
2010/03/01: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature, this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness, such as the effects of Disfigure or Glorious Anthem, will continue to apply, no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon and the land it's enchanting are destroyed at the same time (due to Akroma's Vengeance, for example), the Zendikon's last ability will still trigger.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon's last ability triggers, but the land card it refers to leaves the graveyard before it resolves, it will resolve but do nothing.</Rulings>

2021/03/19: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a creature may become lethal if you switch its power and toughness during that turn.
2021/03/19: Switching a creature's power and toughness twice (or any even number of times) effectively returns the creature to the power and toughness it had before any switches.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: You can't make a spell which is on the stack target itself.
2004/10/04: You can choose to make a spell on the stack target this spell (if such a target choice would be legal had the spell been cast while this spell was on the stack). The new target for the deflected spell is not chosen until this spell resolves. This spell is still on the stack when new targets are selected for the spell.
2004/10/04: If there is no other legal target for the spell, this does not change the target.
2004/10/04: This does not check if the current target is legal. It just checks if the spell has a single target.

<Rulings>2006/09/25: When the life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if player A has 5 life and player B has 3 life before the exchange, player A will lose 2 life and player B will gain 2 life. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.
2011/01/01: If an effect says that a player can't lose life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player who has a lower life total; in that case, the exchange won't happen.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: Any replacement effects are considered by Reflecting Pool when determining the types of mana a land can produce.
2004/10/04: Any change to a land's type or splicing of text into a land can affect the types of mana a land can produce.
2008/05/01: The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
2008/05/01: Reflecting Pool checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands you control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag says "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If you control Vivid Crag and Reflecting Pool, you can tap Reflecting Pool for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2008/05/01: Reflecting Pool doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the mana they produce, such as Pillar of the Paruns and Hall of the Bandit Lord do. It just cares about types of mana.
2008/05/01: Multiple Reflecting Pools won't help each other produce mana. If you control a Reflecting Pool, and all other lands you control either lack mana abilities or are other Reflecting Pools, you may still activate Reflecting Pool's ability — it just won't produce any mana.</Rulings>
