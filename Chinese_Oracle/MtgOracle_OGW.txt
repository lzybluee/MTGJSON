At the beginning of combat on your turn, reveal the top card of your library. If a creature card is revealed this way, you may have creatures you control other than Deceiver of Form become copies of that card until end of turn. You may put that card on the bottom of your library.</CardText>

<Rulings>2016/01/22: You may put the card on the bottom of your library in any of the possible scenarios that could occur with this card. It doesn't matter whether the card is a creature card or not. If it is a creature card, it doesn't matter whether you chose to have the copy effect apply.
2016/01/22: If applicable, creatures you control copy the printed values of the revealed creature card. They will retain any counters they had on them. Any Auras and/or Equipment that were attached with them will remain so.
2016/01/22: Any noncopy effects that affected a creature you control, including ones that modified its power and/or toughness, will continue to apply.
2016/01/22: If a creature you control becomes a copy of the revealed creature card, it's neither entering nor leaving the battlefield. Any enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>407512</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/01/22: Use the new creature's power and toughness at the time the ability resolves to determine the base power and toughness of Eldrazi Mimic. If that creature is no longer on the battlefield at that time, use its power and toughness when it left the battlefield. (Keep in mind that those values may be negative, for example if a spell like Spatial Contortion giving it +3/-3 is what caused it to leave the battlefield.)
2016/01/22: Eldrazi Mimic's ability will overwrite any other effect setting its base power and toughness. Such effects that begin to apply after that ability resolves will similarly overwrite the ability. Effects that modify Eldrazi Mimic's power and/or toughness but don't set its base power and/or toughness to specific values will apply no matter when they started to apply. The same is true for any +1/+1 counters it may have.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/01/22: Kozilek's triggered ability checks to see if you have fewer than seven cards in hand when you cast it. Kozilek is on the stack at this time and not in your hand. If you don't, the ability won't trigger at all. If the ability does trigger, it will check again as it tries to resolve. If you have seven or more cards in hand at that time, the ability won't do anything.
2016/01/22: To activate the last ability, there must be a legal target: a spell on the stack. That target will determine the value of X and the converted mana cost of the card you discard. You can't activate the ability unless you can match the converted mana cost of a spell on the stack to that of a card in your hand.
2016/01/22: The converted mana cost of a spell doesn't change, even if it's been cast using an alternative cost (such as an awaken cost). For example, the converted mana cost of a Sheer Drop (a spell with mana cost {2}{W}) that's been cast for its awaken cost of {5}{W} is 3.
2016/01/22: If there's an {X} in the mana cost of the card you discard, that X is 0. Any {X} in the mana cost of the target spell will have whatever value was determined for it as the spell was cast.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/01/22: For each triggered ability, the game checks to see if the condition is true at the moment the ability would trigger. If the condition isn't true, the ability won't trigger. If the ability does trigger, the game will check again to see if the condition is true as the ability tries to resolve. If it's not true at that time, the ability won't do anything.
2016/01/22: In a multiplayer game, it's possible for the condition to be true at both times but with respect to two different opponents.</Rulings>

2016/01/22: If your opponent puts one of the face-down exiled cards into your graveyard (for example, to activate an ability of an Eldrazi Processor), choose one of the cards at random. The card is revealed only after the cost is fully paid. That is, your opponent can't learn what card was chosen and decide to back up (not cast the spell, activate the ability, or so on, as applicable).</Rulings>

Whenever you cast an Eldrazi creature spell with mana value 7 or greater, you may exile Kozilek's Return from your graveyard. If you do, Kozilek's Return deals 5 damage to each creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Lius Lasahido</Artist>
<Multiverseid>407608</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/01/22: The last ability triggers only if Kozilek's Return is in your graveyard as you cast the Eldrazi creature spell. That ability will resolve before the Eldrazi creature spell does. In other words, that Eldrazi won't be on the battlefield yet and won't be dealt damage by Kozilek's Return.
2016/01/22: Exiling Kozilek's Return due to the last ability isn't the same as casting it as a spell. Cards that say "Counter target spell" won't work.</Rulings>

2016/01/22: If you can't cast the target instant or sorcery card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, or if you choose not to cast it, it will remain in your graveyard.

2016/01/22: A creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a single life-gaining event. For example, if a single creature with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), Cliffhaven Vampire's triggered ability will trigger only once. However, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, the ability will trigger twice.
2016/01/22: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/01/22: Reflector Mage's ability doesn't stop any player from playing lands (in the case that the returned creature was also a land).

The same is true if a double-faced card with its back face up is returned to its owner's hand this way.
2016/01/22: If the returned creature had no name while it was on the battlefield (likely because the creature was face down), its owner can still cast face-down creature spells with morph or megamorph, or cast the same card face up, before your next turn.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/01/22: A land that becomes a creature may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (including its mana abilities) unless it began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when that permanent came under your control, not when it became a creature nor when it entered the battlefield.
2016/01/22: This land is colorless until the last ability gives it colors.
2016/01/22: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2016/01/22: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of a spell with awaken), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if Hissing Quagmire has been made a 0/0 creature with three +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 5/5 creature that's still a land.</Rulings>

<Name>Mirrorpool</Name>
<ChineseName>镜映潭</ChineseName>
<Type>Land</Type>
<CardText>Mirrorpool enters the battlefield tapped.
{T}: Add {C}.
{2}{C}, {T}, Sacrifice Mirrorpool: Copy target instant or sorcery spell you control. You may choose new targets for the copy.
{4}{C}, {T}, Sacrifice Mirrorpool: Create a token that's a copy of target creature you control.</CardText>
<Artist>Cliff Childs</Artist>
<Multiverseid>407684</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/01/22: Mirrorpool's third ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2016/01/22: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2016/01/22: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/01/22: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same modes. You can't choose different ones.
2016/01/22: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Fall of the Titans does), the copy has the same value of X.
2016/01/22: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy, too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2016/01/22: For Mirrorpool's last ability, the token copies exactly what's printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2016/01/22: For example, if a token copies a Plains that's been affected by a spell with awaken, the token will be just a land, even though the object being copied is currently a land creature. The same is true if the land has an ability that animates it.
2016/01/22: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2016/01/22: If the copied creature is copying something else when the ability resolves, then the token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever that creature is copying.
2016/01/22: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.</Rulings>
