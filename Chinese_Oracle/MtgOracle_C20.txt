<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Multiverseid>484708</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: Trynn's ability checks only whether you declared an attacking creature during the turn. It doesn't trigger once for each such creature, and it doesn't check whether any attacking creatures dealt damage.
2020/04/17: "Partner with [name]" represents two abilities. The first is a triggered ability: "When this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library."
2020/04/17: Note that the target player searches their library (which may be affected by effects such as that of Stranglehold) and that the card they find is revealed, even though these words aren't included in the ability's reminder text.
2020/04/17: The second ability represented by the "partner with [name]" keyword modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant and has no function outside of that variant. If a legendary creature card with "partner with [name]" is designated as your commander, the named legendary creature card can also be designated as your commander.
2020/04/17: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Haldan and Pako are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with blue, red, and/or green in their color identity, but not cards with white or black.
2020/04/17: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/04/17: A creature with a "partner with" ability can't partner with any creature other than its designated partner. Losing a partner ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/04/17: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from one of them, not from both of them combined. Command Beacon's effect puts one into your hand from the command zone, not both.
2020/04/17: The triggered ability of the "partner with" keyword still triggers in a Commander game. If your other commander has somehow ended up in your library, you can find it. You can also target another player who might have that card in their library.
2020/04/17: You can activate Silvar's last ability even if it already has indestructible. It'll still get a +1/+1 counter.</Rulings>

You may play lands and cast noncreature spells from among cards you exiled that have fetch counters on them, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast those spells.</CardText>
<Artist>Manuel Castañón</Artist>
<Multiverseid>484709</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: Haldan's ability applies only while it's on the battlefield. You'll be able to play cards you exiled with fetch counters before Haldan entered the battlefield, and if Haldan leaves, you won't be able to play cards that were exiled with fetch counters until Haldan returns.
2020/04/17: Haldan doesn't change when you can play the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
2020/04/17: A creature card that you exiled with a fetch counter on it may be cast as a noncreature spell if a rule or effect (such as that of adventurer cards) allows you to do so.
2020/04/17: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control that Pako fetched are exiled.
2020/04/17: "Partner with [name]" represents two abilities. The first is a triggered ability: "When this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library."
2020/04/17: Note that the target player searches their library (which may be affected by effects such as that of Stranglehold) and that the card they find is revealed, even though these words aren't included in the ability's reminder text.
2020/04/17: The second ability represented by the "partner with [name]" keyword modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant and has no function outside of that variant. If a legendary creature card with "partner with [name]" is designated as your commander, the named legendary creature card can also be designated as your commander.
2020/04/17: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities.

Whenever another creature you control leaves the battlefield, if it had one or more counters on it, you draw a card and you lose 1 life.</CardText>
<Artist>Grzegorz Rutkowski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>484710</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: Nikara's last ability causes you to draw only one card and lose only 1 life, no matter how many counters or kinds of counters that creature had on it.
2020/04/17: If a creature with +1/+1 counters on it receives an equal number of -1/-1 counters and this causes it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, Nikara's last ability triggers. That's because the ability checks the creature as it last existed on the battlefield, and it still had those counters on it at that point.
2020/04/17: If a creature with counters on it leaves the battlefield at the same time as Nikara, Nikara's ability triggers for that creature.
2020/04/17: "Partner with [name]" represents two abilities. The first is a triggered ability: "When this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library."
2020/04/17: Note that the target player searches their library (which may be affected by effects such as that of Stranglehold) and that the card they find is revealed, even though these words aren't included in the ability's reminder text.
2020/04/17: The second ability represented by the "partner with [name]" keyword modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant and has no function outside of that variant.

A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from one of them, not from both of them combined. Command Beacon's effect puts one into your hand from the command zone, not both.
2020/04/17: The triggered ability of the "partner with" keyword still triggers in a Commander game. If your other commander has somehow ended up in your library, you can find it. You can also target another player who might have that card in their library.
2020/04/17: If Yannik leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, you won't exile any creature you control. Yannik's reflexive triggered ability won't trigger.
2020/04/17: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist. When the card returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the card that was exiled.
2020/04/17: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield. It will still let the ability distribute counters.
2020/04/17: Yannik's triggered ability doesn't target the creature you control. That creature is chosen as the triggered ability resolves. After it's exiled, the reflexive triggered ability triggers and targets are chosen to receive the counters.
2020/04/17: Use the power of the creature as it last existed on the battlefield to determine how many +1/+1 counters to distribute.
2020/04/17: You choose how the counters will be distributed as you put the reflexive triggered ability onto the stack. Each target creature must be assigned at least one counter.
2020/04/17: You may choose zero target creatures for Yannik's reflexive triggered ability. If you do, no creature receives +1/+1 counters.
2020/04/17: If one of the target creatures becomes an illegal target in response to the reflexive triggered ability, the +1/+1 counters that would have been put on that creature are lost. They can't be put on another legal target.
2020/04/17: Yannik can be the target of its own reflexive triggered ability.</Rulings>

If you discard a card while a spell or ability is resolving, that spell or ability finishes resolving before Brallin's triggered ability does.'
2020/04/17: Brallin's middle ability gives it only one +1/+1 counter each time it resolves, no matter how many opponents are dealt damage.
2020/04/17: Brallin's middle ability deals 1 damage to each opponent even if you can't put a +1/+1 counter on Brallin, most likely because Brallin has left the battlefield.

<Rulings>2020/04/17: If Kalamax becomes tapped as a cost to cast your first instant spell in a turn, its first ability triggers.

Haste
Whenever Pako, Arcane Retriever attacks, exile the top card of each player's library and put a fetch counter on each of them. Put a +1/+1 counter on Pako for each noncreature card exiled this way.</CardText>
<Artist>Manuel Castañón</Artist>
<Multiverseid>484720</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: You exile cards and put +1/+1 counters on Pako all while Pako's last ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.
2020/04/17: Haldan's ability applies only while it's on the battlefield. You'll be able to play cards you exiled with fetch counters before Haldan entered the battlefield, and if Haldan leaves, you won't be able to play cards that were exiled with fetch counters until Haldan returns.
2020/04/17: Haldan doesn't change when you can play the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
2020/04/17: A creature card that you exiled with a fetch counter on it may be cast as a noncreature spell if a rule or effect (such as that of adventurer cards) allows you to do so.
2020/04/17: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control that Pako fetched are exiled.
2020/04/17: "Partner with [name]" represents two abilities. The first is a triggered ability: "When this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library."
2020/04/17: Note that the target player searches their library (which may be affected by effects such as that of Stranglehold) and that the card they find is revealed, even though these words aren't included in the ability's reminder text.
2020/04/17: The second ability represented by the "partner with [name]" keyword modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant and has no function outside of that variant. If a legendary creature card with "partner with [name]" is designated as your commander, the named legendary creature card can also be designated as your commander.
2020/04/17: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Haldan and Pako are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with blue, red, and/or green in their color identity, but not cards with white or black.
2020/04/17: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/04/17: A creature with a "partner with" ability can't partner with any creature other than its designated partner. Losing a partner ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/04/17: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from one of them, not from both of them combined. Command Beacon's effect puts one into your hand from the command zone, not both.
2020/04/17: The triggered ability of the "partner with" keyword still triggers in a Commander game. If your other commander has somehow ended up in your library, you can find it. You can also target another player who might have that card in their library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/04/17: Brallin's middle ability gives it only one +1/+1 counter each time it resolves, no matter how many opponents are dealt damage.
2020/04/17: Brallin's middle ability deals 1 damage to each opponent even if you can't put a +1/+1 counter on Brallin, most likely because Brallin has left the battlefield.
2020/04/17: If a spell or ability causes you to put cards into your hand without specifically using the word "draw," it's not a card drawn.
2020/04/17: Shabraz's middle ability has you gain 1 life even if you can't put a +1/+1 counter on Shabraz, most likely because Shabraz has left the battlefield.
2020/04/17: If you discard a card as a cost to cast a spell or activate an ability, Brallin's middle ability resolves before that spell or ability but after you've chosen targets for it. If you discard a card while a spell or ability is resolving, that spell or ability finishes resolving before Brallin's triggered ability does.'

2020/04/17: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist. When the card returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the card that was exiled.
2020/04/17: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield. It will still let the ability distribute counters.
2020/04/17: Yannik's triggered ability doesn't target the creature you control. That creature is chosen as the triggered ability resolves. After it's exiled, the reflexive triggered ability triggers and targets are chosen to receive the counters.

2020/04/17: You may choose zero target creatures for Yannik's reflexive triggered ability. If you do, no creature receives +1/+1 counters.
2020/04/17: If one of the target creatures becomes an illegal target in response to the reflexive triggered ability, the +1/+1 counters that would have been put on that creature are lost. They can't be put on another legal target.
2020/04/17: Yannik can be the target of its own reflexive triggered ability.
2020/04/17: Nikara's last ability causes you to draw only one card and lose only 1 life, no matter how many counters or kinds of counters that creature had on it.
2020/04/17: If a creature with +1/+1 counters on it receives an equal number of -1/-1 counters and this causes it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, Nikara's last ability triggers. That's because the ability checks the creature as it last existed on the battlefield, and it still had those counters on it at that point.

<Rulings>2020/04/17: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them, and some cards have an ability that triggers whenever you cycle any card. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2020/04/17: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2020/04/17: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability is countered (with Disallow, for example), the other ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/04/17: If a goaded creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than a player who goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or a player who goaded it.

<Artist>Joe Slucher</Artist>
<Multiverseid>484878</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: Crystalline Resonance copies the printed values of the target permanent, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that permanent or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Notably, it won't copy effects that made the target permanent become a creature.
2020/04/17: If Crystalline Resonance copies a permanent that's copying something else, it will become whatever the target is copying.
2020/04/17: If another permanent becomes a copy of Crystalline Resonance, it will become whatever Crystalline Resonance is copying and it will also have its ability.
2020/04/17: If Crystalline Resonance's ability triggers multiple times in a turn, then each time one of those abilities resolves, it will overwrite whatever Crystalline Resonance is copying. Crystalline Resonance will wind up as a copy of the permanent targeted by the last ability to resolve. As your next turn begins, all instances of the ability will wear off at the same time.
2020/04/17: If an effect begins to apply to Crystalline Resonance before it becomes a copy of another permanent, that effect will continue to apply.
2020/04/17: If Crystalline Resonance becomes a creature the same turn it enters the battlefield, you can't attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (if it gains any) unless it has haste.
2020/04/17: If Crystalline Resonance becomes a copy of a legendary permanent you control, you'll put one of them into its owner's graveyard.
2020/04/17: If Crystalline Resonance becomes a copy of an Aura, it's put into its owner's graveyard unless it's somehow attached to an appropriate object or player already. If it becomes a copy of an Equipment and is attached to a creature, it'll become unattached when it becomes an enchantment again.
2020/04/17: If Crystalline Resonance becomes a copy of a planeswalker, it won't receive loyalty counters for that planeswalker's starting loyalty. Unless it already has loyalty counters on it somehow, it will be put into its owner's graveyard.
2020/04/17: Crystalline Resonance's copy effect wears off immediately before your next turn begins.
2020/04/17: If Crystalline Resonance becomes a copy of an object with a set of linked abilities (for example, one ability that exiles a card and another that refers to the card "exiled with" the object), that link only lasts as long as Crystalline Resonance is copying that object. If it stops being a copy of that object and then becomes a copy again later, the link is lost.
2020/04/17: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them, and some cards have an ability that triggers whenever you cycle any card. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2020/04/17: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.

2021/03/19: Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or mana value. For example, Treasure Cruise's mana value is 8 even if you exiled three cards to cast it.
2021/03/19: You can exile cards to pay only for generic mana, and you can't exile more cards than the generic mana requirement of a spell with delve. For example, you can't exile more than seven cards from your graveyard to cast Treasure Cruise unless an effect has increased its cost.
2021/03/19: Because delve isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs, such as flashback. It can also be used to pay for additional costs that include generic mana.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/04/17: You may look at and play those cards even if Mindleecher leaves the battlefield. If another player gains control of Mindleecher, that player can't look at or play the cards, and you still can.
2020/04/17: You can play lands this way only if you have remaining land plays available for the turn.
2020/04/17: You pay the costs for the exiled cards if you cast them. You may pay alternative costs such as mutate rather than a card's mana cost.
2020/04/17: Mindleecher doesn't change when you can cast the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a creature card without flash, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2020/04/17: Casting the card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
2020/04/17: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control from Mindleecher are exiled, and any cards remaining in exile remain face down indefinitely. No player may look at them.</Rulings>

<Artist>Titus Lunter</Artist>
<Multiverseid>484892</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: Putting a soul counter onto Netherborn Altar is part of the cost to activate its ability, and counting the number of soul counters is done as the ability resolves. Players may take actions between those times to change the number of soul counters, perhaps by removing them all so that you lose no life.
2020/04/17: If Netherborn Altar leaves the battlefield while its ability is on the stack, the amount of life you lose is determined by the number of soul counters it had on it immediately before it left the battlefield.
2020/04/17: The "commander tax" increases based on how many times a commander was cast from the command zone. Casting a commander from your hand doesn't require that additional cost, and it doesn't increase what the cost will be the next time you cast that commander from the command zone.
2020/04/17: If your commander isn't in the command zone (or if you're not playing the Commander variant), Netherborn Altar only makes you lose life.
2020/04/17: If you have two commanders in the command zone, Netherborn Altar's ability puts one of your choice into your hand, not both.</Rulings>

2020/04/17: If a goaded creature can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/04/17: If a goaded creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than a player who goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or a player who goaded it.
2020/04/17: Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded.
2020/04/17: Being goaded more than once by the same player is redundant.
2020/04/17: If you goad a creature you control, it must attack and it must attack a player rather than a planeswalker.
2020/04/17: If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents who hasn't goaded it. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks.</Rulings>

2020/04/17: You divide the damage as Ravenous Gigantotherium's triggered ability is put onto the stack, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage. You can't choose more than X targets and assign 0 damage to a target.
2020/04/17: You may choose zero targets. If you do, Ravenous Gigantotherium deals no damage and is dealt no damage.
2020/04/17: If some of the targets become illegal for Ravenous Gigantotherium's ability, the original division of damage still applies, but the damage that would have been dealt to illegal targets isn't dealt at all.
2020/04/17: The value of X is locked in as you divide the damage while putting Ravenous Gigantotherium's ability onto the stack. Changing Ravenous Gigantotherium's power after that time won't change how much damage is dealt.
2020/04/17: Static abilities, such as that of Glorious Anthem, modify Ravenous Gigantotherium's power before its triggered ability is put onto the stack. Spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities can't raise its power in time to change the value of X.
2020/04/17: The creatures targeted by Ravenous Gigantotherium's ability deal damage back to Ravenous Gigantotherium before dying if they're dealt lethal damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/04/17: You may choose new targets for the additional copy, even if you can't choose new targets for the original copy or copies.
2020/04/17: You choose whether the additional copy is put onto the stack before or after the original copy. If a spell is being copied more than once, you can even have the additional copy put onto the stack in between the original copies.
2020/04/17: If you have a second Twinning Staff, copying a spell results in two additional copies. If you have a third, you get three additional copies, and so on.
2020/04/17: If an effect copies a card rather than a spell (such as that of God-Eternal Kefnet), this doesn't cause an additional copy to be created.
2020/04/17: Twinning Staff's last ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
2020/04/17: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. It will resolve before the original spell does.
2020/04/17: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2020/04/17: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2020/04/17: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy will have the same value of X.
2020/04/17: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Mythos of Vadrok), the division can't be changed, although the targets receiving that damage still can. The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2020/04/17: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

2020/04/17: If either permanent becomes an illegal target, no counter is removed or put.
2020/04/17: The two target permanents don't have to share a type, which can result in some counters on permanents that would not occur normally, such as loyalty counters on creatures or +1/+1 counters on lands. Keyword counters will grant the permanent that keyword even if it's meaningless (such as trample on an enchantment); +1/+1 counters won't affect the permanent unless it's a creature; and many named counters (such as soul counters) won't have an effect unless the recipient permanent refers to them in some way.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/07/01: Banisher Priest's ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring.

The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Clone, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of Banisher Priest.
2013/07/01: In a multiplayer game, if Banisher Priest's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Lius Lasahido</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482713</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.

<Artist>Tyler Jacobson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482714</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: If you have three non-sorcery card types among cards in your graveyard at the time Descend upon the Sinful resolves, you won't get an Angel token. Descend upon the Sinful isn't put into your graveyard until after it's finished resolving.
2016/04/08: If one of those creatures was enchanted, its Aura won't be put into a player's graveyard until after Descend upon the Sinful has finished resolving. If the controller of Descend upon the Sinful owned the Aura, it won't be in the graveyard in time to be counted for the delirium ability.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.</Rulings>

2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.

<Artist>Jim Murray</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482725</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2018/12/07: Reveillark's ability may target zero, one, or two creature cards in your graveyard. Each target must have power 2 or less.</Rulings>

2017/02/09: Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.

2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't permanents. Paying {E} won't satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: All cards in the Aether Revolt set with triggered revolt abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A permanent you controlled must have left the battlefield earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no permanent you controlled has left the battlefield that turn, even if you intend to have one do so in response to the triggered ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/01/22: A creature whose toughness is being increased by Thraben Doomsayer's fateful hour ability loses that bonus as soon as its controller has 6 or more life (or as soon as Thraben Doomsayer leaves the battlefield). If damage marked on that creature is greater than or equal to its toughness after the fateful hour ability stops applying, the creature is destroyed and put into its owner's graveyard.
2011/01/22: If Thraben Doomsayer's activated ability resolves while you have 5 or less life, the creature token will be 3/3 as it enters the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Artist>Aaron Miller</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482733</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/06/08: Together Forever's activated ability checks whether the target creature has a counter on it as the ability is activated and as the ability resolves. If the creature loses its counters later in the turn, the delayed triggered ability will still return it to its owner's hand when it dies.
2018/06/08: If a creature without counters receives enough -1/-1 counters to reduce its toughness to 0 or less, Together Forever's ability can't be activated before state-based actions put that creature into its owner's graveyard.
2018/06/08: You can't put more than one +1/+1 counter on any one target using the support action.
2018/06/08: Support can target a creature another player controls.
2018/06/08: If a spell with support has other abilities that target creatures, those abilities and the support ability can target the same creature.
2018/06/08: If some, but not all, targets for a spell become illegal, the remaining targets are affected as appropriate. If all of a spell's targets become illegal, that spell doesn't resolve.</Rulings>

2012/10/01: You pick one of your opponents when Jace's second ability resolves. The ability doesn't target that opponent. All players may see the revealed cards and offer opinions. You (not your opponent) choose which pile is put into your hand and which pile is put on the bottom of your library.
2012/10/01: Piles can be empty. If one of the piles is empty, you choose to put all the revealed cards in your hand or on the bottom of your library.
2012/10/01: When resolving Jace's third ability, you search each player's library (including yours) and exile the nonland cards before casting any of them.
2012/10/01: For each library, the search is complete only when you explicitly say it is. For example, you can look through one player's library, set that library down, look at another player's library, choose a nonland card in the first library, then choose a nonland card in the second library. Don't reveal any cards from those libraries to any other player until you exile them.
2012/10/01: You cast the cards by putting them on the stack one at a time, choosing modes, targets, and so on. The last card you cast will be the first one to resolve.
2012/10/01: When casting a card this way, ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
2012/10/01: If you can't cast a card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, or if you choose not to cast one, it will remain exiled. Jace's ability won't allow you to cast it later.
2012/10/01: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2012/10/01: If a card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2017/04/18: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Disallow, for example, or if the triggered ability's targets have become illegal), the other ability will still resolve.
2017/04/18: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2017/07/14: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can't be targeted. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and can't be targeted.
2017/07/14: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as prowess and afflict, are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
2017/07/14: If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggers at the beginning of the "next" occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won't trigger again the following time that phase or step occurs.
2017/07/14: Mana abilities can't be targeted. An activated mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool as it resolves, doesn't have a target, and isn't a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool and triggers on an activated mana ability.
2017/07/14: Activated abilities are written in the form "Cost: Effect." Some keyword abilities, such as equip and eternalize, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.</Rulings>

2017/08/25: Reselecting which player or planeswalker a creature is attacking doesn't cause "whenever this creature attacks" abilities to trigger. Notably, the Curses in this set (such as Curse of Vitality) won't trigger while Portal Mage's ability is resolving.

2017/08/25: If an ability targets something controlled by the "defending player" of an attacking creature and the defending player for that creature changes before that ability resolves, the ability won't resolve because its target has become illegal.</Rulings>

2017/07/14: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2017/07/14: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Torment of Hailfire does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2017/07/14: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Chandra's Pyrohelix), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2017/07/14: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2017/04/18: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2017/04/18: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Disallow, for example, or if the triggered ability's targets have become illegal), the other ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast Radiant Flames and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482766</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: Creature cards that have abilities that grant the listed keyword abilities to themselves won't count. For example, exiling a Battle Brawler (a creature with "As long as you control a red or white permanent, Battle Brawler gets +1/+0 and has first strike") with Soulflayer's delve ability won't cause Soulflayer to have first strike, even if you control a red or white permanent.
2014/11/24: You can't exile more cards from your graveyard than you'd need to pay Soulflayer's generic mana requirement. In most situations, this means you can't exile more than four cards, even if you want to exile more to give it extra abilities.
2020/01/24: If one of those creature cards has one or more variants of the listed keywords (for example, hexproof from white), this creature gains those specific variants.
2021/03/19: Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or mana value. For example, Treasure Cruise's mana value is 8 even if you exiled three cards to cast it.
2021/03/19: You can exile cards to pay only for generic mana, and you can't exile more cards than the generic mana requirement of a spell with delve. For example, you can't exile more than seven cards from your graveyard to cast Treasure Cruise unless an effect has increased its cost.
2021/03/19: Because delve isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs, such as flashback. It can also be used to pay for additional costs that include generic mana.</Rulings>

2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions.

<Rulings>2017/11/17: The instant or sorcery card returned to your hand is chosen at random as Charmbreaker Devils's first ability resolves. If any player responds to the ability, that player won't yet know what card will be returned.
2017/11/17: Because the first ability doesn't target the instant or sorcery card, any instants or sorceries put into your graveyard in response to that ability may be returned to your hand.
2017/11/17: All players get to see which card you chose at random as it's returned to your hand.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jung Park</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482776</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The number of targets you choose for Comet Storm is one more than the number of times it's kicked. First you declare how many times you're going to kick the spell (at the same time you declare the value of X), then you choose the targets accordingly, then you pay the costs. No player can respond between the time you declare how many times you'll kick the spell and the time you choose the targets.
2010/03/01: Each target you choose must be different.
2010/03/01: For example, if you want Comet Storm to deal 4 damage to each of three different targets, that means X is 4 and you're kicking the spell twice. You'll pay a mana cost of {4}{R}{R}, plus a kicker cost of {1}, plus another kicker cost of {1}, for a total of {6}{R}{R}.
2010/03/01: As long as any of its targets are legal at the time Comet Storm resolves, Comet Storm will deal X damage to each of those legal targets.</Rulings>

<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482778</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: Dualcaster Mage's triggered ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2016/06/08: As Dualcaster Mage's triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell on the stack. The copy isn't cast, so abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2016/06/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/06/08: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2016/06/08: If the spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/06/08: If the spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2016/06/08: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>482779</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: If you cast any of the exiled cards, you do so as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. You can't wait to cast them later in the turn. Timing permissions based on a card's type are ignored, and the spells resolve before blockers are declared.
2021/03/19: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the card.
2021/03/19: If an exiled card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/03/19: If you cast more than one of the exiled cards, you choose the order in which to cast them. A spell you cast this way can be the target of a later spell you cast this way. However, permanent spells cast this way won't resolve until you're done casting spells, so the permanents they become can't be the target of spells cast this way. For example, if you exile Twincast and Lightning Strike, you can cast Lightning Strike and then cast Twincast targeting it; but if you exile a creature card and an Aura card, you can't cast that Aura targeting that creature.
2021/03/19: Any cards not cast, including land cards, remain in exile. They can't be cast on later turns, even if Etali attacks again.
2021/03/19: Because all attacking creatures are chosen at once, a creature cast this way can't attack during the same combat as Etali, even if it has haste.
2021/03/19: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control from Etali's ability are exiled.</Rulings>

2016/01/22: If you can't cast the target instant or sorcery card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, or if you choose not to cast it, it will remain in your graveyard.

2016/01/22: If an instant or sorcery card you cast this way goes to a zone other than exile or a graveyard, perhaps because one of its abilities says to put it into its owner's hand, it won't be exiled. This is true even if the card would be put into a graveyard later that turn.</Rulings>

2014/11/24: If you exile a land card using the "Khans" ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2014/11/24: If a noncreature card is manifested and then leaves the battlefield while face down, the "Dragons" ability will trigger.
2014/11/24: Each Siege will have one of the two listed abilities, depending on your choice as it enters the battlefield.
2014/11/24: The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept. "[Anchor word] — [Ability]" means "As long as you chose [anchor word] as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability]." Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.
2014/11/24: Each of the last two abilities is linked to the first ability. They each refer only to the choice made as a result of the first ability. If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege. Which ability the copy has won't depend on the choice made for the original permanent.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482789</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.
2010/06/15: Surreal Memoir isn't targeted. You don't choose an instant card at random from your graveyard until it resolves. Once you randomly select a card, it's too late for players to respond.
2010/06/15: If you have only one instant card in your graveyard as Surreal Memoir resolves, that's the one you'll return to your hand.
2010/06/15: If you're playing a format involving only cards from the _Urza's Saga_(TM) set and later, you may change the order of your graveyard at any time. That means the easiest way to choose an instant card at random from your graveyard is to take all the instant cards in your graveyard, turn them face down, shuffle them, and pick a card. Then you just put the rest back.
2010/06/15: If you're playing a format involving cards printed earlier than the _Urza's Saga_ set, you may not reorder your graveyard. In this case, you need to be more careful when selecting an instant card at random, perhaps by using dice, writing the names of the instant cards on slips of paper and choosing one of them randomly, or carefully noting the existing graveyard order so you can reestablish it after performing the method suggested above, for example.
2010/06/15: If you have multiple instant cards in your graveyard with the same name, and one of them is being targeted by another spell on the stack or is enchanted (with Spellweaver Volute, for example), you must differentiate them so you know which one (if any) is chosen at random. In that case, it may be better to use dice or another method that allows you to differentiate between the instant cards to choose one at random.
2010/06/15: All players get to see which card you chose at random.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>482794</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: No player will know the order of the cards put on the bottom of your library. Practically speaking, the cards should be shuffled (although this is not the game action of "shuffling").
2015/06/22: If the spell mastery ability applies, you untap only the lands put onto the battlefield with Animist's Awakening.
2015/06/22: If you have X or less cards in your library, you'll reveal all the cards from your library, put all land cards from among them onto the battlefield tapped, and then put the rest of the cards back in your library in a random order. (This is effectively the same as shuffling your library, although it's still not technically a shuffle.)
2015/06/22: Check to see if there are two or more instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard as the spell resolves to determine whether the spell mastery ability applies. The spell itself won't count because it's still on the stack as you make this check.</Rulings>

2017/11/17: If you put an Aura onto the battlefield this way, you choose what it enchants as it enters the battlefield. This doesn't target any permanent or player, but it must be able to enchant that permanent or player. For example, you could put a green Aura onto the battlefield enchanting a creature with hexproof controlled by an opponent, but not one with protection from green.

2010/03/01: As long as any of its targets are legal at the time Strength of the Tajuru resolves, you'll put X +1/+1 counters on each of those legal targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/07/01: The ability that triggers when Vastwood Hydra dies doesn't target any of the creatures. You can choose to put counters on a creature with protection from green, for example.
2013/07/01: You choose how the counters will be distributed when the ability resolves.
2013/07/01: In some unusual cases, Vastwood Hydra will have enough -1/-1 counters put on it to make its toughness 0 or less. If this happens, the ability will still distribute a number of +1/+1 counters equal to the number of +1/+1 counters on Vastwood Hydra before the -1/-1 counters were put on it. For example, if Vastwood Hydra has two +1/+1 counters on it and three -1/-1 counters are put on it, two +1/+1 counters will be distributed.</Rulings>

2016/08/23: It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked a player with, only that you attacked a player with at least one creature. For example, if you attack one player with Wings of the Guard and another player with five creatures, Wings of the Guard will get +2/+2 until end of turn.
2016/08/23: Melee will trigger if the creature with melee attacks a planeswalker. However, the effect counts only opponents (and not planeswalkers) that you attacked with a creature when determining the bonus.
2016/08/23: Creatures that enter the battlefield attacking were never declared as attackers, so they won't count toward melee's effect. Similarly, if a creature with melee enters the battlefield attacking, melee won't trigger.</Rulings>

2013/09/15: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2013/09/15: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2013/09/15: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2014/02/01: You can use the last ability to put any land card with the subtype Forest or Plains onto the battlefield, not just ones named Forest or Plains.
2014/02/01: If you cast a creature card with bestow for its bestow cost, it becomes an Aura spell and not a creature spell. Karametra's last ability won't trigger.
2020/01/24: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat. It won't rejoin combat if it resumes being a creature later during that combat.
2020/01/24: Your devotion to two colors is the number of mana symbols among mana costs of permanents you control that are the first color, the second, or both. If an effect counts your devotion to two colors, a hybrid symbol that is both of those colors is counted just once.
2020/01/24: The type-changing ability that can make a God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color. It's always a creature spell while it's on the stack.
2020/01/24: As a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color will determine whether any replacement effects that affect creatures entering the battlefield apply to that God. Because replacement effects are considered before the God is on the battlefield, the mana symbols in its mana cost won't be counted when determining this.
2020/01/24: When a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and the creature type God. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2020/01/24: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2020/01/24: Counters put on a God remain on it while it's not a creature, even if they have no effect.
2020/01/24: If an effect causes a God to lose all abilities, its ability that causes it to stop being a creature still applies if appropriate.
2020/11/10: Karametra's abilities function as long as it's on the battlefield, regardless of whether it's a creature.
2020/11/10: If Karametra stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and the creature type God. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2020/11/10: If an effect causes Karametra to lose all abilities, its ability that causes it to stop being a creature still applies if appropriate.
2020/11/10: When Karametra enters the battlefield, your devotion to green and white will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield. The mana symbols in Karametra's own mana cost are counted when determining this.
2020/11/10: Counters put on Karametra remain on it while it's not a creature, even if they have no effect.
2020/11/10: If Karametra is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat. It won't rejoin combat if it resumes being a creature later during that combat.
2020/11/10: An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2020/11/10: The type-changing ability that can make Karametra not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color. It's always a creature spell while it's on the stack.
2020/11/10: As Karametra enters the battlefield, your devotion to green and white will determine whether any replacement effects that affect creatures entering the battlefield apply.

<CardText>Play with the top card of your library revealed.
You may cast instant and sorcery spells from the top of your library.
Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your library, copy it. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Jason Chan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482848</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Melek doesn't affect the timing rules associated with when you can cast the card. If it's a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2013/04/15: You still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs, such as overload costs. Although you can't pay additional costs for the copy that's created, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/04/15: Melek's last ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell you cast from your library, not just one with targets.
2013/04/15: When the last ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2013/04/15: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Debt to the Deathless has), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/04/15: Instant and sorcery cards with miracle allow a player to cast a card immediately upon drawing it. If you cast a spell this way, you're casting it from your hand, not your library. Melek's ability won't trigger.
2013/04/15: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't suspend it, cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2013/04/15: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, the new top card won't be revealed until you finish doing so.
2013/04/15: When playing with the top card of your library revealed, if an effect tells you to draw several cards, reveal each one before you draw it.</Rulings>

2017/03/14: Some spells instruct you to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast that spell. If you sacrifice Wort to pay that cost, that spell won't have conspire at the moment it becomes cast, so conspire won't trigger, even if you tapped two creatures.

<Rulings>2017/07/14: A token permanent with cycling will go to your graveyard before ceasing to exist. It won't be exiled. Similarly, a nontoken permanent that lost cycling while it was on the battlefield will also go to your graveyard.
2017/07/14: If you cycle an instant card, you may cast it from your graveyard right away before any player may take any other action. If you do, that spell will resolve before the cycling ability. If you cycle a noninstant card without flash, you can't cast it until after the cycling ability has resolved.
2017/07/14: Abandoned Sarcophagus doesn't grant you permission to do anything with those cards except cast them. For example, you can't cycle nonland cards with cycling from your graveyard.
2017/07/14: Certain older cards have variants of cycling, such as basic landcycling or Wizardcycling. Abandoned Sarcophagus's effect lets you cast these cards and exiles them if they weren't discarded for their cycling variant's ability.</Rulings>

{3}, {T}: Create a token that's a copy of a card exiled with Mimic Vat. It gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step.</CardText>
<Artist>Donato Giancola</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482874</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: If multiple nontoken creatures are put into their owners' graveyards from the battlefield at the same time, the imprint ability will trigger that many times. You put the triggered abilities on the stack in any order, so you'll determine in which order they resolve. However, since exiling those cards is optional, and choosing to exile a card this way causes the previously exiled cards to return to their owners' graveyards, the order generally doesn't matter: You'll wind up with at most one of those cards exiled, and the rest will be in the appropriate graveyards.
2011/01/01: You may exile a noncreature card with Mimic Vat's first ability. For example, if a nontoken artifact that's become a creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, Mimic Vat's first ability triggers and you may exile that card.
2011/01/01: The token created by the second ability will be a copy of whatever card is exiled with Mimic Vat at the time the ability resolves. This might not be the same card that was exiled with Mimic Vat at the time the ability was activated. It also might not be a creature card.
2011/01/01: If the token is a copy of a noncreature card, it will still have haste, though that won't matter unless that token somehow becomes a creature.
2011/01/01: You may activate the second ability even if no card has been exiled with Mimic Vat. If no card has been exiled with Mimic Vat by the time the ability resolves, no token will be created.
2011/01/01: The imprint ability will trigger whenever a nontoken creature is put into any graveyard from the battlefield, not just your graveyard.
2011/01/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the exiled card will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the exiled card will also work.
2011/01/01: The token is exiled at the beginning of the next end step regardless of who controls it at that time, whether the exiled card is still exiled at that time, or whether Mimic Vat is still on the battlefield at that time.
2011/01/01: If Mimic Vat's second ability is activated during a turn's end step, the token will be exiled at the beginning of the following turn's end step.
2011/01/01: If the token isn't exiled when the delayed triggered ability resolves (due to Stifle, perhaps), it remains on the battlefield indefinitely. It continues to have haste.
2011/01/01: If the exiled card has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be 0.
2011/01/01: Exiling the card as the first ability resolves is optional. If you choose not to exile it, or you can't exile it because the card has somehow left the graveyard before the ability resolves, the ability simply doesn't do anything as it resolves. Any card currently exiled by Mimic Vat remains exiled.
2016/07/13: If a melded permanent dies and triggers Mimic Vat's triggered ability, both of its component cards are exiled. As Mimic Vat's second ability resolves, its controller chooses one of those cards to make a token copy of.
2018/07/13: If the creature that dies is an instant or sorcery card that's been manifested, Mimic Vat may have a nonpermanent card exiled. You can't create a token that's a copy of a nonpermanent card. No token is created in this case.</Rulings>

2015/08/25: If one of these lands enters the battlefield at the same time as any number of basic lands, those other lands are not counted when determining if this land enters the battlefield tapped or untapped.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"It was a strange morning. When we awoke, we found our trees transformed. We didn't know whether to water them or polish them."
—Pulan, Bant orchardist</Flavor>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482901</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. Exotic Orchard can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/02/01: Exotic Orchard checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control Exotic Orchard, you can tap Exotic Orchard for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/02/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, Exotic Orchard takes into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there are more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/02/01: Exotic Orchard doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.
2009/02/01: Lands that produce mana based only on what other lands "could produce" won't help each other unless some other land allows one of them to actually produce some type of mana. For example, if you control an Exotic Orchard and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard and a Reflecting Pool, none of those lands would produce mana if their mana abilities were activated. On the other hand, if you control a Forest and an Exotic Orchard, and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard and a Reflecting Pool, then each of those lands can be tapped to produce {G}. Your opponent's Exotic Orchard can produce {G} because you control a Forest. Your Exotic Orchard and your opponent's Reflecting Pool can each produce {G} because your opponent's Exotic Orchard can produce {G}.</Rulings>

{T}: Add one mana of any color in your commander's color identity. When that mana is spent to cast a creature spell that shares a creature type with your commander, scry 1. (Look at the top card of your library. You may put that card on the bottom of your library.)</CardText>
<Artist>Alayna Danner</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482926</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: If you don't have a commander, Path of Ancestry's ability produces no mana.
2020/11/10: If you have two commanders, the last ability adds one mana of any color in their combined color identities.
2020/11/10: Your commander's creature types are checked immediately after you cast a creature spell spending mana from Path of Ancestry's last ability. They aren't set before the game begins, and they may not be the same types your commander had when you activated that ability. Notably, if your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or is phased out, it's considered to have no creature types.
2020/11/10: If your commander is a card that has no colors in its color identity, Path of Ancestry's ability produces no mana. It doesn't produce {C}.
2020/11/10: If you cast your commander with mana from Path of Ancestry, and your commander hasn't somehow lost all of its creature types while on the stack, you'll scry 1.
2020/11/10: If your commander has no creature types, it can't share a creature type with any spell that you cast.
2020/11/10: If Path of Ancestry's last ability produces two mana (most likely due to Mana Reflection), spending those two mana to cast creature spells that share a creature type with your commander will cause two abilities to trigger. Each of those abilities will cause you to scry 1. You won't scry 2. This is true whether you spend the mana on one creature spell or two.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: Even though these lands have basic land types, they are not basic lands because "basic" doesn't appear on their type line. Notably, controlling two or more of them won't allow others to enter the battlefield untapped.
2015/08/25: However, because these cards have basic land types, effects that specify a basic land type without also specifying that the land be basic can affect them. For example, a spell or ability that reads "Destroy target Forest" can target Canopy Vista, while one that reads "Destroy target basic Forest" cannot.
2015/08/25: If one of these lands enters the battlefield at the same time as any number of basic lands, those other lands are not counted when determining if this land enters the battlefield tapped or untapped.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order.

However, if those permanents enter the battlefield in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two.</Rulings>
