When Angel of Salvation enters the battlefield, prevent the next 5 damage that would be dealt this turn to any number of targets, divided as you choose.</CardText>
<Artist>D. Alexander Gregory</Artist>
<Multiverseid>130345</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: You divide the prevention effects as Angel of Salvation's triggered ability is put onto the stack, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 prevention "shield." You can't choose more than five targets and assign none to a target.
2021/03/19: If some of the targets become illegal for Angel of Salvation's ability, the original division of prevention effects still applies, but the effects that would have been created for illegal targets aren't created at all.
2021/03/19: If multiple sources would deal damage to an affected target at once, that target or that target's controller chooses which source's damage to prevent for each "shield."
2021/03/19: If multiple replacement effects apply to a player or permanent being dealt damage, that player or the controller of that permanent chooses the order to apply them, not the controller of the source of damage.
2021/03/19: You can tap any untapped creature you control to convoke a spell, even one you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn.
2021/03/19: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated. Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or mana value.
2021/03/19: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<CardText>Until your next turn, creatures can't attack you. Exile Chronomantic Escape with three time counters on it.
Suspend 3—{2}{W} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{W} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Franz Vohwinkel</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126204</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Chronomantic Escape can affect creatures that aren't on the battlefield at the time it resolves, because it modifies the announcement of an attack, not the creatures on the battlefield. For example, if Chronomantic Escape resolves on your turn, then on your opponent's turn they cast a creature with haste, that creature can't attack that turn.
2014/02/01: Unless some effect explicitly says otherwise, a creature that can't attack you can still attack a planeswalker you control.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.

2021/03/19: If an attacking creature has multiple evasion abilities, such as shadow and flying, a creature can block it only if that creature satisfies all of the appropriate evasion abilities.
2021/03/19: Multiple instances of shadow on the same creature are redundant.</Rulings>

If an opponent would search a library, that player searches the top four cards of that library instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Rebecca Guay</Artist>
<Multiverseid>136204</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: Each search works exactly the same as normal except that the opponent doing the searching sees only the top four cards of that library. They can't look at the other cards in that library at all. Cards not in the top four cards of the library can't be found in the search, even if they're identifiable in some manner.
2021/03/19: For effects that check whether a player searched a library or may search a library, searching the top four cards of that library counts as searching that library.
2021/03/19: If an effect uses the word "search" once but allows an opponent to search for multiple cards, the top four cards remain the same throughout the entire search. Finding one card won't cause the fifth card to become included in the search.
2021/03/19: After the search is complete, the entire library is shuffled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: Tribal is a card type (like creature or instant), not a supertype (like legendary). The type carries no rules that affect how it's cast or how it behaves on the battlefield; it just allows the card to have creature types without being a creature.
2021/03/19: If you put Bound in Silence onto the battlefield without casting it, perhaps using the "recruiting" ability of a card like Amrou Scout, it will enter attached to a creature. You choose that creature as you're putting the Aura onto the battlefield. This doesn't target that creature, so you could have it enter the battlefield attached to a creature an opponent controls with hexproof, for example. If there's no creature on the battlefield it can be attached to, it stays in whatever zone it was in.
2021/03/19: If Bound in Silence becomes attached to a creature that's already attacking or blocking, the creature continues to attack or block as normal.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ron Spears</Artist>
<Multiverseid>132228</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: When the last time counter is removed from the exiled card, it's cast as a completely new spell. Modes and targets are chosen again. If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, they must be paid again. If they can't be, the spell can't be cast and stays exiled.
2021/03/19: If the target spell was cast with flashback, Delay's effect will exile it, not the flashback effect. The card will get time counters and gain suspend (if it didn't already have suspend).
2021/03/19: If the target spell is face down, it'll be exiled face up. It can't be cast face down when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.</Rulings>

2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, you don't reveal the new top card until you finish doing so.

Suspend 3—{2}{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{U} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126153</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.

2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

2021/03/19: Split second doesn't stop triggered abilities from triggering, such as that of Chalice of the Void. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
2021/03/19: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
2021/03/19: If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.

It can counter a spell with mana cost 0 (such as Slaughter Pact), a spell cast via an alternative nonmana cost (such as Allosaurus Rider) or alternative cost of {0} (such as Basking Rootwalla), a spell whose cost to cast it was reduced to 0 (such as Frogmite), a spell cast without paying its cost due to an effect (such as suspend or Mindleech Mass's ability), or a copy of a spell, among other possibilities. It will not counter a spell that had an additional or alternative mana cost paid to cast it, regardless of that spell's mana value (such as a face-down spell cast with morph, or an Ornithopter cast while Trinisphere is on the battlefield, for example).
2007/05/01: Nix checks whether any player paid mana to cast the spell, not whether its current controller did. If Commandeer is cast on a spell, then Nix is cast on that spell, Nix won't counter it unless the player who originally cast that spell spent no mana to cast it.</Rulings>

<CardText>Enchant instant card in a graveyard

<Rulings>2007/05/01: This Aura targets, and enchants, an instant card in a graveyard. This is the first Aura that enchants something that's neither a permanent nor a player.
2007/05/01: The Aura will be on the battlefield attached to a card in a different zone. The Aura won't be in the graveyard. The enchanted card won't be on the battlefield.
2007/05/01: If the enchanted card changes zones (due to being cast with flashback, or being exiled with Cremate, for example), Spellweaver Volute "falls off" and is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2007/05/01: When you cast a sorcery spell, Spellweaver Volute's ability triggers. It will make a copy of the enchanted card. The copy will exist in the graveyard. You'll have the option to cast the copy. If you don't, the copy remains in the graveyard and ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked. If you do cast the copy, the copy is cast from the graveyard. After you finish casting it, the enchanted card is exiled and you must choose a new instant card in a graveyard to attach Spellweaver Volute to. If you can't, Spellweaver Volute remains on the battlefield attached to nothing and is then put into the graveyard the next time state-based actions are checked.
2007/05/01: Say Spellweaver Volute's ability triggers, then the enchanted instant card is exiled in response. Spellweaver Volute, which is now enchanting nothing, is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. When the Volute's ability resolves, it will check its last existence on the battlefield and identify the "enchanted card" as "nothing," so no copy is created.
2007/05/01: Say Spellweaver Volute's ability triggers, then Spellweaver Volute leaves the battlefield in response. Then the instant card that was enchanted is removed from the graveyard in response. When the Volute's ability resolves, it will check its last existence on the battlefield and identify the "enchanted card" as that instant card, so the card is copied and controller of the triggered ability may cast it.</Rulings>

2009/02/01: Wizardcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Wizardcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Wizardcycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Wizardcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Wizardcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Wizard creature type, even if it isn't a creature card. This includes, for example, Tribal cards with the Changeling ability. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Wizard card in your library.</Rulings>

<Artist>Brandon Kitkouski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126131</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: If an ability triggers when the object that has it is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, that ability triggers from the battlefield and isn't affected by Yixlid Jailer.
2021/03/19: If an ability triggers when the object that has it is put into a graveyard from anywhere other than the battlefield, such as Krosan Tusker or Narcomoeba, that ability triggers from the graveyard. Yixlid Jailer stops those abilities from triggering at all. This includes abilities that trigger when a card is put into a graveyard "from anywhere," even if that card was on the battlefield.
2021/03/19: Some replacement effects cause a card to be put somewhere else instead of being put into a graveyard (such as that of Darksteel Colossus). These effects mean the card is never actually put into the graveyard, so Yixlid Jailer doesn't affect that ability.
2021/03/19: Some cards have abilities that apply "as [this card] enters the battlefield" or state that "[this card] enters the battlefield with" counters. Although these cards won't have these abilities in the graveyard, they will be applied if the cards are put onto the battlefield from the graveyard (due to Zombify, perhaps). What matters is that these cards will have these abilities on the battlefield.
2021/03/19: If a card with changeling is in a graveyard, it still has all creature types.
2021/03/19: If a card in a graveyard has an ability that defines a * in its power or toughness, that * is 0. For example, Tarmogoyf is a 0/1 creature card in your graveyard while you control Yixlid Jailer.
2021/03/19: If a spell or ability allows you to cast a spell from your graveyard, the first step in doing so is to move it to the stack. That spell's additional and alternative costs may be applied. However, if a card's own ability allows you to cast it from your graveyard (such as a flashback ability) Yixlid Jailer stops that ability.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>126193</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: Each time you cast Arc Blade, it will suspend itself again when it resolves so you can cast it again three turns later.
2021/03/19: If the chosen target is an illegal target by the time Arc Blade tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You don't exile it with time counters on it.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.

2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.

<Artist>Dave Kendall</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126201</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: When Shivan Sand-Mage enters the battlefield, if there are no suspended cards and no permanents with time counters on them, you can't choose the second mode. You'll have to choose the first mode, and will have to choose a permanent as a target (though, in this case, the ability won't do anything when it resolves).
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

2021/03/19: Slivercycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Slivercycling a card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Slivercycling from being activated.</Rulings>

<CardText>Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn. Exile Cyclical Evolution with three time counters on it.
Suspend 3—{2}{G} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{G} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Matt Cavotta</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126169</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

2021/03/19: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Artist>Michael Bruinsma</Artist>
<Multiverseid>136143</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: Epochrasite will enter the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it if you cast it from a zone other than your hand, or if an effect let you put it directly onto the battlefield.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

2020/08/07: If a creature is entering the battlefield under your control, consider static abilities to determine whether its power and toughness are both 1. Spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities can't be used to raise or lower the creature's power and toughness in time to have the last ability trigger or to stop it from triggering.
2020/08/07: Once the last ability has triggered, changing the power or toughness of the creature won't stop you from returning Sword of the Meek and attaching it to the creature.

<Rulings>2017/11/17: Nimbus Maze's last two abilities check the subtypes of lands you control, not their names. You can activate the appropriate abilities as long as you control a land with the corresponding subtype, Plains or Island. Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Nimbus Maze itself is neither a Plains nor an Island, while Hallowed Fountain is both.</Rulings>
