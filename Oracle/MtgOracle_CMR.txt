<Rulings>2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.
2020/11/10: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2020/11/10: You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you've cast each from the command zone clear for "commander tax" purposes.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: The Soldier token that you create enters the battlefield as a 1/1 creature. Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield will see the token enter as a 1/1 creature. Static abilities that affect the Soldier's power and toughness may change this, but Ancestral Blade will be attached to the Soldier before the game checks to see if it has toughness 0 or less. For example, if Illness in the Ranks ("Creature tokens get -1/-1") is on the battlefield, the Soldier will enter as a 0/0 creature, but then Ancestral Blade will make it a 1/1 and the token will survive.
2020/11/10: No player may take any actions between the time you create the Soldier token and the time Ancestral Blade becomes attached to it.
2020/11/10: If the triggered ability causes two Soldiers to be created (due to an effect such as that of Doubling Season), Ancestral Blade becomes attached to one of them.</Rulings>

For example, abilities that trigger on that damage being dealt still trigger; if the source has lifelink, its controller still gains life; and so on.
2020/11/10: Combat damage dealt to you by a commander is still tracked, even if it didn't cause you to lose life.
2020/11/10: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch (if any) ceases being the monarch.
2020/11/10: There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. The full texts of these abilities are "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."
2020/11/10: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.
2020/11/10: If the monarch leaves the game during another player's turn, that player becomes the monarch. If the monarch leaves the game during their turn, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch.
2020/11/10: If combat damage dealt to the monarch causes that player to lose the game, the triggered ability that causes the controller of the attacking creature to become the monarch doesn't resolve.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: Only attacking creatures that have flying as Kangee's Lieutenant's second ability resolves will get +1/+1. Giving a creature flying or making it lose flying after that point won't change that bonus, if any.
2020/11/10: Exiling the card with encore is a cost to activate the ability. Once you announce that you're activating it, no player may take actions until you've finished. They can't try to remove the card from your graveyard to stop you from paying the cost.
2020/11/10: Opponents who have left the game aren't counted when determining how many tokens to create.
2020/11/10: The tokens copy only what's on the original card. Effects that modified that creature when it was previously on the battlefield won't be copied.
2020/11/10: Each token must attack the appropriate player if able.
2020/11/10: If one of the tokens can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/11/10: If an effect stops a token from attacking a specific player, that token can attack any player or planeswalker, or not attack at all. If the effect stops the token from attacking a specific player unless a cost is paid, you don't have to pay that cost unless you want to attack that player.
2020/11/10: If one of the tokens somehow is under another player's control as the delayed triggered ability resolves, you can't sacrifice that token. It remains on the battlefield indefinitely, even if you regain control of it later.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: If a creature you control dies, but it isn't a creature card in the graveyard (perhaps because it was a noncreature that became a creature), Promise of Tomorrow will still exile it, and it may return it to the battlefield later.
2020/11/10: Players can respond to the first ability of Promise of Tomorrow to try and move the card to another zone (even exile) before Promise of Tomorrow exiles it.
2020/11/10: If you control more than one Promise of Tomorrow, each creature you control that dies will cause the triggered ability of each of them to trigger. Those abilities can be put on the stack in any order, and the first one to resolve is the one that exiles the creature card. That creature card will be exiled by that Promise of Tomorrow, and only that Promise of Tomorrow can return it.
2020/11/10: Similarly, if you control more than one Promise of Tomorrow, they will each trigger at the beginning of the end step if you control no creatures. These abilities can be put on the stack in any order, and the first one to resolve will be sacrificed and return cards to the battlefield if appropriate. The next ability to try and resolve will check to see if you control any creatures at that time. If you do, the ability won't resolve, Promise of Tomorrow won't be sacrificed, and it won't return any cards.</Rulings>

<Artist>Sidharth Chaturvedi</Artist>
<Multiverseid>497578</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: Azure Fleet Admiral's last ability normally means that it can't be blocked while attacking the monarch or a planeswalker the monarch controls. In some variants with shared team turns, such as Two-Headed Giant, creatures controlled by the monarch's teammate can block Azure Fleet Admiral, even if it's attacking the monarch.
2020/11/10: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch (if any) ceases being the monarch.
2020/11/10: There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. The full texts of these abilities are "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."
2020/11/10: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.
2020/11/10: If the monarch leaves the game during another player's turn, that player becomes the monarch. If the monarch leaves the game during their turn, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch.
2020/11/10: If combat damage dealt to the monarch causes that player to lose the game, the triggered ability that causes the controller of the attacking creature to become the monarch doesn't resolve. In most cases, the controller of the attacking creature will still become the monarch as it is likely their turn.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.
2020/11/10: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2020/11/10: You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you've cast each from the command zone clear for "commander tax" purposes.</Rulings>

This means that combat restrictions on creatures with flying (such as that of Sandwurm Convergence) don't apply, but abilities that trigger on creatures with flying attacking (such as that of Windreader Sphinx) do trigger.</Rulings>

Encore {4}{U} ({4}{U}, Exile this card from your graveyard: For each opponent, create a token copy that attacks that opponent this turn if able. They gain haste. Sacrifice them at the beginning of the next end step. Activate only as a sorcery.)</CardText>
<Artist>Sidharth Chaturvedi</Artist>
<Multiverseid>497597</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: Exiling the card with encore is a cost to activate the ability. Once you announce that you're activating it, no player may take actions until you've finished. They can't try to remove the card from your graveyard to stop you from paying the cost.
2020/11/10: Opponents who have left the game aren't counted when determining how many tokens to create.
2020/11/10: The tokens copy only what's on the original card. Effects that modified that creature when it was previously on the battlefield won't be copied.
2020/11/10: Each token must attack the appropriate player if able.
2020/11/10: If one of the tokens can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/11/10: If an effect stops a token from attacking a specific player, that token can attack any player or planeswalker, or not attack at all. If the effect stops the token from attacking a specific player unless a cost is paid, you don't have to pay that cost unless you want to attack that player.
2020/11/10: If one of the tokens somehow is under another player's control as the delayed triggered ability resolves, you can't sacrifice that token. It remains on the battlefield indefinitely, even if you regain control of it later.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: Malcolm's triggered ability will trigger even if Pirates you control deal damage to only a single opponent. A single Treasure for you. Yarrr.
2020/11/10: Malcolm's triggered ability considers all damage dealt by Pirates you control to opponents, not just combat damage.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.
2020/11/10: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2020/11/10: You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you've cast each from the command zone clear for "commander tax" purposes.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason A. Engle</Artist>
<Multiverseid>497609</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: The "legend rule" is the rule that states that if a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. (704.5j at the time of this document's creation for those of you scoring at home.)
2020/11/10: While the "legend rule" doesn't apply to permanents you control, you can control any number of legendary permanents with the same name and none of them will be put into the graveyard.
2020/11/10: If you control more than one legendary permanent with the same name and the "legend rule" begins applying again (perhaps because Sakashima of a Thousand Faces leaves the battlefield), you'll immediately have to comply with the rule and put all but one of those permanents into the graveyard.
2020/11/10: Sakashima of a Thousand Faces copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below), except that it also has Sakashima's other abilities. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Most notably, if it copies a creature that's not normally a creature, it won't be a creature.
2020/11/10: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2020/11/10: If the chosen creature is copying something else, then Sakashima enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2020/11/10: If another creature becomes a copy of Sakashima, that creature also has Sakashima's other abilities.
2020/11/10: If the chosen creature is a token, Sakashima copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put that token onto the battlefield. Sakashima doesn't become a token in this case.
2020/11/10: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Sakashima enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2020/11/10: If Sakashima somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2020/11/10: If Sakashima is your commander, it remains your commander even if it's copying another creature. If Sakashima is not your commander, it remains not your commander even if it's copying your commander.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2020/11/10: Countering the spell with cascade has no effect on the cascade ability.
2020/11/10: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2020/11/10: If you cast a permanent spell using the cascade ability of Sakashima's Protege, that permanent will be on the battlefield in time to be copied by Sakashima's Protege.
2020/11/10: Sakashima's Protege copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2020/11/10: If Sakashima's Protege enters the battlefield as a copy of a planeswalker, it will enter with a number of loyalty counters on it equal to the loyalty printed in the lower right corner of the planeswalker. It won't copy the number of counters currently on that planeswalker.
2020/11/10: If the chosen permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2020/11/10: If the chosen permanent is copying something else (for example, if the chosen permanent is another Sakashima's Protege), then Sakashima's Protege enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen permanent copied.
2020/11/10: If the chosen permanent is a token, Sakashima's Protege copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put that token onto the battlefield. Sakashima's Protege doesn't become a token in this case.
2020/11/10: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when Sakashima's Protege enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2020/11/10: If Sakashima's Protege somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield and entered the battlefield this turn.
2020/11/10: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2020/11/10: You don't have to cast the last card exiled by a cascade ability. If you choose to do so, you're casting it as a spell. This means that it can be countered, and appropriate abilities trigger (such as if that spell also has cascade).
2020/11/10: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the spell.
2020/11/10: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2020/11/10: The converted mana cost of a spell with cascade is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: Sakashima's Will copies the printed values of the chosen creature. It won't copy any counters on that creature or any effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Notably, it won't copy effects that made the chosen creature become a creature if it isn't normally a creature. For example, if you choose a land that's become a creature, all your other creatures will become noncreature lands until end of turn.

2020/11/10: Once you've announced that you're casting a spell, players can't take any actions until you've finished doing so. Notably, opponents can't try to remove your commander to change how many modes you may choose.
2020/11/10: Once you've chosen both modes for the spell, it doesn't matter whether you continue to control a commander. This is true even if you somehow no longer control a commander as you finish casting the spell.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>497615</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: Use the number of attacking creatures with flying as the ability resolves to determine the value of X.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.
2020/11/10: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2020/11/10: You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you've cast each from the command zone clear for "commander tax" purposes.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: Skilled Animator doesn't remove any abilities the target artifact has.
2020/11/10: The artifact retains any types, subtypes, or supertypes it has.
2020/11/10: If an Equipment becomes an artifact creature, it can't be attached to another creature. If it was attached to a creature, it becomes unattached.
2020/11/10: If the artifact was already a creature, its base power and toughness will each become 5. This overwrites any previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Skilled Animator's ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
2020/11/10: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the ones created by Titanic Growth or a +/1+1 counter, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.
2020/11/10: The resulting artifact creature will be able to attack on your turn if it's been under your control continuously since the turn began. That is, it doesn't matter how long it's been a creature, just how long it's been on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: The additional beginning phase will be a lot like your normal beginning phase. During the untap step, permanents will phase in or out as appropriate and you'll untap your tapped permanents. Anything that triggers "at the beginning of your upkeep" or similar will trigger during the upkeep step, and you'll eventually draw a card for your draw step.
2020/11/10: The additional beginning phase all happens during the current turn. Any effects that last "until your next turn" or similar won't expire just because you'll go through an additional beginning phase.
2020/11/10: After the additional beginning phase, the game proceeds to the ending phase (unless something has added even more phases; see below.)
2020/11/10: If multiple phases are added to the same point in your turn, the most recently created phase happens first. For example, say you control Sphinx of the Second Sun and its ability triggers during your postcombat main phase. Later during that same main phase, another effect gives you an additional combat phase after this main phase. The additional combat will happen first, followed by the additional beginning phase.
2020/11/10: Even if you don't attack with any creatures during combat, you'll still get a postcombat main phase and Sphinx of the Second Sun's ability will still trigger.
2020/11/10: If you somehow have more than two main phases in a turn, each main phase other than the first one is a postcombat main phase, and Sphinx of the Second Sun's ability triggers at the beginning of each of them.</Rulings>

If they are, they choose a card without revealing it (or two cards without revealing them, if you're the monarch), then each other opponent in turn order does the same. Then each chosen card is discarded simultaneously, and finally each player who couldn't or didn't discard loses the appropriate amount of life.
2020/11/10: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch (if any) ceases being the monarch.
2020/11/10: There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. The full texts of these abilities are "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."

2020/11/10: If the monarch leaves the game during another player's turn, that player becomes the monarch. If the monarch leaves the game during their turn, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch.
2020/11/10: If combat damage dealt to the monarch causes that player to lose the game, the triggered ability that causes the controller of the attacking creature to become the monarch doesn't resolve. In most cases, the controller of the attacking creature will still become the monarch as it is likely their turn.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice.

2020/11/10: Feast of Succession affects only creatures on the battlefield at the time it resolves. Creatures that enter the battlefield later in the turn won't get -4/-4.
2020/11/10: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch (if any) ceases being the monarch.
2020/11/10: There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. The full texts of these abilities are "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."
2020/11/10: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.

2020/11/10: If combat damage dealt to the monarch causes that player to lose the game, the triggered ability that causes the controller of the attacking creature to become the monarch doesn't resolve.

2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.
2020/11/10: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2020/11/10: You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you've cast each from the command zone clear for "commander tax" purposes.</Rulings>

Then all creatures are sacrificed simultaneously. Finally, you'll create the six tapped Zombies.

You control your opponents while they're searching their libraries.

<Artist>Scott Murphy</Artist>
<Multiverseid>497661</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: While controlling an opponent, you make all choices and decisions for that player. However, because the control effect is limited to while they're searching their libraries, it's unlikely the player will be allowed to make any decisions other than what to find with the search.
2020/11/10: You can't have the player find cards in their library that aren't asked for by the search instruction. For example, if the opponent is searching their library for a basic land card, you can't have them find a different card, such as a creature card.
2020/11/10: If the search instruction states a quality of the card to find, such as a color or card type, you may have the opponent not find any cards. If the search is simply for a number of cards without stating a quality, you must have them find that many cards (or as many as possible, if their library doesn't contain that many cards).
2020/11/10: While controlling an opponent, you can't make any choices or decisions for that player related to tournament rules. You can't make them concede or have them agree to an intentional draw.
2020/11/10: The cards found in the search will be exiled rather than be put wherever the spell or ability tells the opponent to put them after finding them. Any other effects the spell or ability has will still apply. If such an effect refers to the found cards, it can see them in exile.
2020/11/10: If a spell or ability instructs an opponent you control to search multiple zones including the library, you decide what cards they find in all zones. They'll exile all cards they find in any of the zones.
2020/11/10: If more than one player controls an Opposition Agent, and another player searches their library, the controller of the Opposition Agent that most recently entered the battlefield controls that player during the search. Because the last ability of each Opposition Agent is trying to exile the card and give permission to play it, the owner of the exiled card chooses which effect wins. However, that owner will be under another player's control, so that player controlling that owner actually makes the decision. In other words, the player who controls the Opposition Agent whose effect applies (and thus controls the opponent) can choose to give themselves all the play permissions unless they're feeling very generous.
2020/11/10: You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions for each exiled card. If one is a land, you can't play it unless you have land plays available.
2020/11/10: You'll still pay all costs for a spell cast this way, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs if any are available.
2020/11/10: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well.</Rulings>

Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.
2020/11/10: If a player can't gain life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player with a higher life total. Similarly, a player who can't lose life can't exchange life totals with a player with a lower life total.
2020/11/10: Use the difference between the life totals after the exchange to determine the size of the Horror token. Because replacement effects can modify the life gain and life loss, this number may be different from what it was before the exchange.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: If you leave the game, all creatures owned by other players that were put onto the battlefield under your control are exiled.
2020/11/10: Exiling the card with encore is a cost to activate the ability. Once you announce that you're activating it, no player may take actions until you've finished. They can't try to remove the card from your graveyard to stop you from paying the cost.
2020/11/10: Opponents who have left the game aren't counted when determining how many tokens to create.
2020/11/10: The tokens copy only what's on the original card. Effects that modified that creature when it was previously on the battlefield won't be copied.
2020/11/10: Each token must attack the appropriate player if able.
2020/11/10: If one of the tokens can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/11/10: If an effect stops a token from attacking a specific player, that token can attack any player or planeswalker, or not attack at all. If the effect stops the token from attacking a specific player unless a cost is paid, you don't have to pay that cost unless you want to attack that player.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: Each opponent considers their creatures independently. For example, if one opponent controls creatures with powers 4 and 5, and another opponent controls creatures with powers 2 and 7, the creatures with powers 5 and 7 will be sacrificed.
2020/11/10: If an opponent controls more than one creature with the greatest power among creatures they control, they choose which one to sacrifice.
2020/11/10: If both modes are chosen, they happen in the stated order. Any creature cards that end up in an opponent's graveyard because they were sacrificed for the first mode will be exiled as the instructions for the second mode are followed.
2020/11/10: For the second mode, use the powers of the creature cards as they existed in the graveyard to determine the value of X.
2020/11/10: If both modes are chosen, and an opponent sacrifices a creature token to the first mode, that token will be in the graveyard as the instructions in the second mode are followed.

<Rulings>2016/08/23: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward.
2016/08/23: Being the monarch carries two inherent triggered abilities. "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."
2016/08/23: Abilities that trigger whenever you "become the monarch" trigger only if you aren't already the monarch. For example, if you are already the monarch as Custodi Lich enters the battlefield, its last ability won't trigger.
2016/08/23: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack, and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.
2020/11/10: If combat damage dealt to the monarch causes that player to lose the game, the triggered ability that causes the controller of the attacking creature to become the monarch doesn't resolve. In most cases, the controller of the attacking creature will still become the monarch as it is likely their turn.
2020/11/10: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch (if any) ceases being the monarch.
2020/11/10: There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. The full texts of these abilities are "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."
2020/11/10: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.

<Multiverseid>497681</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: Aurora Phoenix's last ability triggers only if it's in your graveyard immediately after you finish casting the spell with cascade.
2020/11/10: An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2020/11/10: The cascade ability of the spell you cast and Aurora Phoenix's return ability can be put on the stack in either order. If you return Aurora Phoenix to your hand first, you do so before exiling any cards for the cascade ability. If the cascade ability resolves first, the spell you cast because of that cascade ability will resolve before you return Aurora Phoenix to your hand. Either way, this all happens before the original spell with cascade resolves.
2021/03/19: The mana value of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If cascade allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half but not both halves.
2021/03/19: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the card.
2021/03/19: If the last card exiled is a card with an Adventure, you may only cast the spell as an Adventure if that spell has a lesser mana cost than the spell with cascade.
2021/03/19: The mana value of a modal double-faced card in exile is that of its front face. If the last card you exile is a modal double-faced card, you may only cast the back face if the resulting spell would also have a lesser mana value than the spell with cascade.
2021/03/19: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/03/19: A spell's mana value is determined only by its mana cost. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions. For example, Bloodbraid Elf's mana value is always 4.
2021/03/19: Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2021/03/19: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2021/03/19: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Blasphemous Act). The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/11/10: Blasphemous Act's ability can't reduce the total cost to cast the spell below {R}.
2020/11/10: The total cost to cast Blasphemous Act is locked in before you pay that cost. For example, if there are three creatures on the battlefield, including one you can sacrifice to add {C} to your mana pool, the total cost of Blasphemous Act is {5}{R}. Then you can sacrifice the creature when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost.
2020/11/10: Although players may respond to Blasphemous Act once it's been cast, once it's announced, they can't respond before the cost is calculated and paid.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: If one of the tokens somehow is under another player's control as the delayed triggered ability resolves, you can't sacrifice that token. It remains on the battlefield indefinitely, even if you regain control of it later.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: Dargo's first ability can't reduce its cost below {R}. You can sacrifice any number of artifacts and creatures, even if they won't reduce Dargo's cost any further.
2020/11/10: The cost reduction for artifacts and creatures sacrificed earlier in the turn will apply even if you don't sacrifice any as an additional cost.
2020/11/10: The cost reduction is {2} per sacrificed permanent, whether that permanent was an artifact, a creature, or both.
2020/11/10: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases (such as the commander tax), then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Dargo's first ability). Dargo's converted mana cost is 7, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.
2020/11/10: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2020/11/10: You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you've cast each from the command zone clear for "commander tax" purposes.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: Once you announce that you're casting a commander spell, players can't take action until you've finished casting it. Causing Flamekin Herald to leave the battlefield after the spell has been cast won't stop its cascade ability from resolving.
2020/11/10: In some unusual situations, you may lose control of Flamekin Herald during the process of casting a commander spell. In those situations, the commander spell won't have cascade.
2020/11/10: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2020/11/10: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.

2020/11/10: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the spell.
2020/11/10: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

For example, say you activate that ability targeting a 5/5 creature with trample, attack one of your opponents with that creature, and that creature is blocked by a 3/3 creature. You could assign 3 damage to the blocking creature and 2 damage to the defending player. If you did, your attacker would deal 3 damage to the blocking creature and 6 damage (2 damage tripled) to the defending player. All of the damage remains combat damage.
2020/11/10: If a creature is targeted by Jeska's second ability twice, combat damage it would deal one of your opponents is multiplied by nine. Three abilities multiply the damage by twenty-seven, and so on.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.

2020/11/10: You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you've cast each from the command zone clear for "commander tax" purposes.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: If you lose the flip and the spell is returned to its owner's hand, it's removed from the stack and won't resolve. This isn't the same as countering the spell, and a spell that can't be countered can be returned to hand.
2020/11/10: Krark's ability triggers at the same time as any other abilities that say "When you cast this spell" or similar, including cascade. Those abilities may be put on the stack in any order. Those triggered abilities are unaffected by the original spell being returned to hand, countered, or otherwise removed from the stack.
2020/11/10: If you cast a copy of an instant or sorcery card (for example, one created by Mnemonic Deluge), and the spell is returned to its owner's hand, it will cease to exist. You won't be able to cast it again.
2020/11/10: If you win the flip, the copy will resolve before the original spell does.
2020/11/10: If you win the flip, the spell will be copied even if it doesn't require targets.
2020/11/10: If you win the flip, but the spell that caused Krark's triggered ability to trigger isn't on the stack anymore (most likely because it was countered), the copy is still created.
2020/11/10: If you lose the flip, but the spell that caused Krark's triggered ability to trigger isn't on the stack anymore (most likely because it was countered), nothing is returned to your hand. The card stays in its current zone.
2020/11/10: If you copy a spell with targets, the copy will have the same targets unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for any of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, that target remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2020/11/10: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it has a bulleted list of modes), the copy will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
2020/11/10: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy will have the same value of X.
2020/11/10: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Monstrous Onslaught), the division can't be changed, although the targets receiving that damage still can. The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2020/11/10: You can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2020/11/10: The copy from winning the flip is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities.

<Artist>Andrey Kuzinskiy</Artist>
<Multiverseid>497721</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: As Soulfire Eruption resolves, if you have chosen multiple targets (and we really hope you have), those targets will be handled one at a time in turn order. Start with targets that are either the player whose turn it is (probably you) or permanents that player controls. You choose the relative order of targets within that group. For whichever target you select first, exile the top card of your library, then Soulfire Eruption deals damage to that target. Repeat this process for each subsequent target in the group. After that group is done, move on to targets that are either the next player in turn order or permanents they control. Again, you choose the relative order of targets in that group. Repeat the whole process for each other player.
2020/11/10: Nothing can happen in between the damage being dealt to each target, and no player can choose to take actions. Any abilities that trigger while Soulfire Eruption is resolving go on the stack after Soulfire Eruption finishes resolving.
2020/11/10: If you're playing with the top card of your library revealed (perhaps because of Courser of Kruphix), you'll see the new top card of your library after each time a card is exiled while Soulfire Eruption's ability is resolving. Notably, you'll see which card is on top of your library before selecting from among the targets in each group. For example: in a three-player game, you're playing with the top card of your library revealed and you cast Soulfire Eruption targeting your two opponents and a creature controlled by the last opponent in turn order. You exile the top card of your library and Soulfire Eruption deals damage to the first opponent. You'll see the new top card of your library before selecting whether the next target will be the last opponent or the creature they control.
2020/11/10: Soulfire Eruption doesn't change when you can play the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
2020/11/10: Playing an exiled card causes it to leave exile. Soulfire Eruption won't let you play it multiple times, even if the card later returns to exile somehow.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: The creature equipped by Rock is the source of the activated ability, not Rock or Toggo. For example, if the equipped creature is blue, you could activate the ability choosing a creature with protection from artifacts or protection from red as the target.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.
2020/11/10: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards (or 58 cards in a Commander Draft game) of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.
2020/11/10: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2020/11/10: You can choose two commanders with partner that are the same color or colors. In Commander Draft, you can even choose two of the same commander with partner if you drafted them. If you do this, make sure you keep the number of times you've cast each from the command zone clear for "commander tax" purposes.</Rulings>

<Artist>Grzegorz Rutkowski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>497728</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2020/11/10: The value of X is calculated as Volcanic Torrent resolves. It will include Volcanic Torrent, spells you cast in response to Volcanic Torrent, and spells you cast prior to casting Volcanic Torrent, even if those spells haven't resolved yet. For example, say the first spell you cast in a turn has cascade and that cascade ability causes you to cast Volcanic Torrent. Then Volcanic Torrent's cascade ability causes you to cast another spell. When Volcanic Torrent resolves, X will be 3.
2020/11/10: If you copy a spell, Volcanic Torrent won't count the copy. However, if an effect instructs you to copy a card and then cast the copy, it will be counted by Volcanic Torrent.
2020/11/10: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2020/11/10: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2020/11/10: Countering the spell with cascade has no effect on the cascade ability.
2020/11/10: You don't have to cast the last card exiled by a cascade ability. If you choose to do so, you're casting it as a spell. This means that it can be countered, and appropriate abilities trigger (such as if that spell also has cascade).
2020/11/10: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the spell.
2020/11/10: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2020/11/10: The converted mana cost of a spell with cascade is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.</Rulings>

This doesn't change even if one or more of the spells you cast because of those cascade abilities has cascade itself. Each of those additional cascade abilities, if any, will refer to the mana value of the spell that caused it to trigger. In other words, each cascade ability cares only about the spell that caused it to trigger, the stack can get messy, and we wish you luck.
2020/11/10: Each instance of cascade triggers and resolves separately. The spell you cast due to the first cascade ability will go on the stack on top of the second, third, and fourth cascade abilities.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: Court of Bounty's ability isn't the same as playing a land. You may still play a land for the turn if you put a land onto the battlefield with it.
2020/11/10: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch (if any) ceases being the monarch.
2020/11/10: There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. The full texts of these abilities are "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."
2020/11/10: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.
2020/11/10: If the monarch leaves the game during another player's turn, that player becomes the monarch. If the monarch leaves the game during their turn, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch.
2020/11/10: If combat damage dealt to the monarch causes that player to lose the game, the triggered ability that causes the controller of the attacking creature to become the monarch doesn't resolve. In most cases, the controller of the attacking creature will still become the monarch as it is likely their turn.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: Opponents who have left the game aren't counted when determining how many tokens to create.
2020/11/10: The tokens copy only what's on the original card. Effects that modified that creature when it was previously on the battlefield won't be copied.
2020/11/10: Each token must attack the appropriate player if able.
2020/11/10: If one of the tokens can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/11/10: If an effect stops a token from attacking a specific player, that token can attack any player or planeswalker, or not attack at all. If the effect stops the token from attacking a specific player unless a cost is paid, you don't have to pay that cost unless you want to attack that player.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: An ability that triggers when a player spends mana to cast a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2020/11/10: If an effect causes Gilanra's ability to produce more than one mana (such as that of Mana Reflection), the delayed triggered ability will be created for each of those mana, and you'll draw a card each time one of those mana is spent to cast a spell with converted mana cost 6 or greater. If you spend two of those mana to cast a single spell with converted mana cost 6 or greater, you'll draw two cards.

2020/11/10: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.

If you do, a second ability triggers and you pick a target that will be dealt damage. This is different from abilities that say "If you do . . ." in that players may cast spells and activate abilities after mana is paid but before damage is dealt.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: A land that becomes a creature because of the first mode will retain any other supertypes, card types, subtypes, and abilities it had.
2020/11/10: If you choose both modes, the effects happen in the listed order. The lands will become 1/1 creatures in time to deal damage to the target of the second mode.
2020/11/10: If some but not all of the targets become illegal, Kamahl's Will will resolve but have no effect on illegal targets. If the target of the second mode becomes illegal, no damage will be dealt.
2020/11/10: Even though the card is named after a specific character, controlling any commander will satisfy its condition.

2020/11/10: Once you've chosen both modes for the spell, it doesn't matter whether you continue to control a commander. This is true even if you somehow no longer control a commander as you finish casting the spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/11/10: If a permanent or a permanent card in your hand has {X} in its mana cost, {X} is considered to be 0.
2020/11/10: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Falthis and Kediss are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with black and/or red in their color identity, but not cards with green, white, or blue.

2020/11/10: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from any one of them, not from both of them combined.
2020/11/10: If something refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to one of them of your choice. If you are instructed to perform an action on your commander (e.g. put it from the command zone into your hand due to Command Beacon), you choose one of your commanders at the time the effect happens.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2020/11/10: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2020/11/10: Countering the spell with cascade has no effect on the cascade ability.
2020/11/10: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2020/11/10: You don't have to cast the last card exiled by a cascade ability. If you choose to do so, you're casting it as a spell. This means that it can be countered, and appropriate abilities trigger (such as if that spell also has cascade).
2020/11/10: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the spell.
2020/11/10: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: Numa's triggered ability goes on the stack without a target. While that ability is resolving, you may pay {X}{X}. If you do, a second ability triggers. You choose the target Elves and announce how the +1/+1 counters will be distributed as you put that ability on the stack. Each target must receive at least one +1/+1 counter. This is different from abilities that say "If you do . . ." in that players may cast spells and activate abilities after mana is paid but before counters are placed.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: A permanent that wasn't a creature as it entered the battlefield this turn but is currently a creature can be chosen as a target of Sweet-Gum Recluse's last ability.
2020/11/10: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2020/11/10: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2020/11/10: Countering the spell with cascade has no effect on the cascade ability.
2020/11/10: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2020/11/10: You don't have to cast the last card exiled by a cascade ability. If you choose to do so, you're casting it as a spell. This means that it can be countered, and appropriate abilities trigger (such as if that spell also has cascade).
2020/11/10: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the spell.
2020/11/10: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2020/11/10: The converted mana cost of a spell with cascade is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: Exiling the card with encore is a cost to activate the ability. Once you announce that you're activating it, no player may take actions until you've finished. They can't try to remove the card from your graveyard to stop you from paying the cost.
2020/11/10: Opponents who have left the game aren't counted when determining how many tokens to create.
2020/11/10: The tokens copy only what's on the original card. Effects that modified that creature when it was previously on the battlefield won't be copied.
2020/11/10: Each token must attack the appropriate player if able.
2020/11/10: If one of the tokens can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/11/10: If an effect stops a token from attacking a specific player, that token can attack any player or planeswalker, or not attack at all. If the effect stops the token from attacking a specific player unless a cost is paid, you don't have to pay that cost unless you want to attack that player.

2021/03/19: The mana value of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If cascade allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half but not both halves.
2021/03/19: If the last card exiled is a card with an Adventure, you may only cast the spell as an Adventure if that spell has a lesser mana cost than the spell with cascade.
2021/03/19: The mana value of a modal double-faced card in exile is that of its front face. If the last card you exile is a modal double-faced card, you may only cast the back face if the resulting spell would also have a lesser mana value than the spell with cascade.
2021/03/19: A spell's mana value is determined only by its mana cost. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions. For example, Bloodbraid Elf's mana value is always 4.
2021/03/19: Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2021/03/19: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.

<Multiverseid>497800</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: Once you announce that you're casting a spell, players can't take action until you've finished casting it. Causing Imoti, Celebrant of Bounty to leave the battlefield after a spell with converted mana cost 6 or greater has been cast won't stop that spell's cascade ability from resolving.
2020/11/10: In some unusual situations, you may lose control of Imoti during the process of casting a spell with converted mana cost 6 or greater. In those situations, that spell won't have cascade.
2020/11/10: For spells with {X} in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine the spell's converted mana cost.
2020/11/10: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2020/11/10: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2020/11/10: Countering the spell with cascade has no effect on the cascade ability.
2020/11/10: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2020/11/10: You don't have to cast the last card exiled by a cascade ability. If you choose to do so, you're casting it as a spell. This means that it can be countered, and appropriate abilities trigger (such as if that spell also has cascade).
2020/11/10: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the spell.
2020/11/10: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2020/11/10: The converted mana cost of a spell with cascade is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.</Rulings>

<CardText>When Jared Carthalion, True Heir enters the battlefield, target opponent becomes the monarch. You can't become the monarch this turn.

<Multiverseid>497801</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Jared Carthalion while you're the monarch, the damage is dealt and you'll simultaneously put that many +1/+1 counters on it, all before the game checks for lethal damage.
2020/11/10: If you're the monarch and damage would be dealt to Jared Carthalion at the same time combat damage is dealt to you, Jared Carthalion's last ability will prevent damage and put counters on it before the triggered ability that makes another player the monarch resolves.
2020/11/10: If the first ability resolves but the target opponent can't become the monarch (perhaps because they also had a Jared Carthalion enter the battlefield earlier in the turn), the current monarch stays the monarch, even if that player is you.
2020/11/10: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch (if any) ceases being the monarch.
2020/11/10: There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. The full texts of these abilities are "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."
2020/11/10: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.
2020/11/10: If the monarch leaves the game during another player's turn, that player becomes the monarch. If the monarch leaves the game during their turn, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch.
2020/11/10: If combat damage dealt to the monarch causes that player to lose the game, the triggered ability that causes the controller of the attacking creature to become the monarch doesn't resolve. In most cases, the controller of the attacking creature will still become the monarch as it is likely their turn.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>497805</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: As each end step begins, if you haven't gained life that turn, Lathiel's triggered ability won't trigger at all. If it does trigger, you choose the targets and how the +1/+1 counters will be distributed as you put the ability on the stack. Each target must receive at least one +1/+1 counter.
2020/11/10: You may choose no targets if you want. In that case, no +1/+1 counters are put on any creature.
2020/11/10: If some, but not all, of the creatures are illegal targets as the triggered ability tries to resolve, the original distribution of counters still applies and the counters that would have been put on illegal targets are lost. If all of the creatures are illegal targets, the ability won't resolve.
2020/11/10: Gaining more life in response to the triggered ability won't change how many counters will be distributed, nor will it change the distribution.
2020/11/10: The triggered ability will consider the total amount of life you've gained that turn, not how your life total has changed. For example, if you start the turn at 10 life, then gain 5 life, and then lose 7 life, you'll distribute five +1/+1 counters, even though your life total is now lower than it was at the beginning of the turn.</Rulings>

This includes spells and abilities that can't be countered. 2) If there are any attacking and blocking creatures, they're removed from combat. 3) State-based actions are checked. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack. 4) The current phase and/or step ends.

Encore {12} ({12}, Exile this card from your graveyard: For each opponent, create a token copy that attacks that opponent this turn if able. They gain haste. Sacrifice them at the beginning of the next end step. Activate only as a sorcery.)</CardText>
<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Multiverseid>497851</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/11/10: Exiling the card with encore is a cost to activate the ability. Once you announce that you're activating it, no player may take actions until you've finished. They can't try to remove the card from your graveyard to stop you from paying the cost.
2020/11/10: Opponents who have left the game aren't counted when determining how many tokens to create.
2020/11/10: The tokens copy only what's on the original card. Effects that modified that creature when it was previously on the battlefield won't be copied.
2020/11/10: Each token must attack the appropriate player if able.
2020/11/10: If one of the tokens can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/11/10: If an effect stops a token from attacking a specific player, that token can attack any player or planeswalker, or not attack at all. If the effect stops the token from attacking a specific player unless a cost is paid, you don't have to pay that cost unless you want to attack that player.
2020/11/10: If one of the tokens somehow is under another player's control as the delayed triggered ability resolves, you can't sacrifice that token. It remains on the battlefield indefinitely, even if you regain control of it later.</Rulings>

2020/11/10: The triggered ability of Rings of Brighthearth and the copy it creates both resolve before the ability that caused it to trigger. They resolve even if that ability is countered.
2020/11/10: The copy will have the same targets as the ability it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them.

<Rulings>2020/11/10: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch (if any) ceases being the monarch.
2020/11/10: There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. The full texts of these abilities are "At the beginning of the monarch's end step, that player draws a card" and "Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch."
2020/11/10: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.
2020/11/10: If the monarch leaves the game during another player's turn, that player becomes the monarch. If the monarch leaves the game during their turn, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch.
2020/11/10: If combat damage dealt to the monarch causes that player to lose the game, the triggered ability that causes the controller of the attacking creature to become the monarch doesn't resolve. In most cases, the controller of the attacking creature will still become the monarch as it is likely their turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Felix</Artist>
<Multiverseid>500848</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/07/13: If you sacrifice a creature with {X} in its mana cost, that X is considered to be 0.
2016/07/13: A "when you cast" triggered ability resolves before the original spell resolves. It resolves even if the original spell is countered, and the original spell resolves even if the triggered ability is countered.
2016/07/13: Each card with emerge is colorless and has an emerge cost that includes one or more colors of mana. These cards are still colorless if you pay the emerge cost.
2016/07/13: A creature's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner (unless that creature is the back face of a double-faced card, is a melded permanent, or is copying something else; see below). If the mana cost includes {X}, X is considered to be 0. If it's a single-faced card with no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's an animated land, for example), its converted mana cost is 0. Ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) that were paid as the creature was cast.
2016/07/13: Colored mana components of emerge costs can't be reduced with emerge.
2016/07/13: You may sacrifice a creature with a converted mana cost of 0, such as a token creature that's not a copy of another permanent, to cast a spell for its emerge cost. You'll just pay the full emerge cost with no reduction.
2016/07/13: You may sacrifice a creature with converted mana cost greater than or equal to the emerge cost. If you do, you'll pay only the colored mana component of the emerge cost.
2016/07/13: The converted mana cost of the back face of a double-faced card is the converted mana cost of its front face. The converted mana cost of a melded permanent is the sum of the converted mana costs of its front faces. A creature that's a copy of either has a converted mana cost of 0.
2016/07/13: The converted mana cost of a creature spell with emerge isn't affected by whether its emerge cost is paid. For example, if you cast Elder Deep-Fiend for its emerge cost and sacrifice a creature whose converted mana cost is 3, Elder Deep-Fiend's converted mana cost remains 8.
2016/07/13: The creature chosen to be sacrificed is still on the battlefield up through the time that you activate mana abilities. Its abilities may affect the spell's cost, be activated to generate mana, and so on. However, if it has an ability that triggers when a spell is cast, it will have been sacrificed before that ability can trigger.
2016/07/13: Once you begin to cast a spell with emerge, no player may take actions until you're done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the creature you wish to sacrifice.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: If the targeted permanent is an illegal target by the time Into the Roil resolves, the entire spell doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card.
2020/09/25: An ability that triggers when a player casts a kicked spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2020/09/25: If you copy a kicked spell, the copy is also kicked. If a card or token enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's already on the battlefield, the new permanent isn't kicked, even if the original was.
2020/09/25: If you put a permanent with a kicker ability onto the battlefield without casting it, you can't kick it.
2020/09/25: If the target nonland permanent is an illegal target by the time Into the Roil tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card if it was kicked.
2020/09/25: Kicker represents an optional additional cost that you may choose to pay as you cast the spell. A spell cast with that additional cost paid is "kicked."
2020/09/25: You can't pay a kicker cost more than once.
2020/09/25: To determine a spell's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases (such as kicker), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2020/09/25: Some instant or sorcery spells require alternative or additional targets if they're kicked. You ignore these targeting requirements if those spells aren't kicked, and you can't kick those spells unless you can choose the appropriate targets. On the other hand, you can kick a permanent spell even if you won't be able to choose targets for an enters-the-battlefield ability of that permanent once the spell resolves.</Rulings>

2014/02/01: Tromokratis (like all attacking and blocking creatures) remains an attacking or blocking creature until the end of combat step is over. Notably, it will still be an attacking or blocking creature during the combat damage step, so any abilities an opponent controls that trigger when a creature dies as a result of combat damage could target Tromokratis.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jung Park</Artist>
<Multiverseid>500891</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The number of targets you choose for Comet Storm is one more than the number of times it's kicked. First you declare how many times you're going to kick the spell (at the same time you declare the value of X), then you choose the targets accordingly, then you pay the costs. No player can respond between the time you declare how many times you'll kick the spell and the time you choose the targets.
2010/03/01: Each target you choose must be different.
2010/03/01: For example, if you want Comet Storm to deal 4 damage to each of three different targets, that means X is 4 and you're kicking the spell twice. You'll pay a mana cost of {4}{R}{R}, plus a kicker cost of {1}, plus another kicker cost of {1}, for a total of {6}{R}{R}.
2010/03/01: As long as any of its targets are legal at the time Comet Storm resolves, Comet Storm will deal X damage to each of those legal targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/06/08: Dualcaster Mage's triggered ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2016/06/08: As Dualcaster Mage's triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell on the stack. The copy isn't cast, so abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2016/06/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/06/08: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2016/06/08: If the spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/06/08: If the spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2016/06/08: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>500899</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: Wild Ricochet can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2013/07/01: When Wild Ricochet resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. The controller of the original spell retains control of that spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2013/07/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/07/01: If the spell Wild Ricochet copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/07/01: If the spell Wild Ricochet copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Volcanic Geyser does), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/07/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with Wild Ricochet, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/07/01: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

2021/03/19: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
2021/03/19: If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.
2021/03/19: After a spell with split second resolves (or otherwise leaves the stack), players may again cast spells and activate abilities before the next object on the stack resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kieran Yanner</Artist>
<Multiverseid>500915</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2015/08/25: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2015/08/25: If the ability has an additional or replacement effect that depends on the land having a certain basic land type, the ability will check that land's type as the ability resolves. If, at that time, the land that entered the battlefield is no longer on the battlefield, use its types when it left the battlefield to determine what happens.</Rulings>

Suspend 2—{G} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {G} and exile it with two time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Randy Gallegos</Artist>
<Multiverseid>500916</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

Whenever a +1/+1 counter is put on Fathom Mage, you may draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Multiverseid>500925</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/01/24: If multiple +1/+1 counters are placed on Fathom Mage simultaneously, its last ability will trigger once for each of those counters.
2013/01/24: If Fathom Mage enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it (perhaps due to Master Biomancer), its last ability will trigger once for each +1/+1 counter it entered the battlefield with.
2013/01/24: Fathom Mage's last ability will trigger whenever any +1/+1 counter is placed on it, not just ones due to the evolve ability.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.
2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

Retrace (You may cast this card from your graveyard by discarding a land card in addition to paying its other costs.)</CardText>
<Flavor>Spitting is the customary greeting between a creature and its magical impostor.</Flavor>
<Artist>Jim Nelson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>500933</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/08/01: Casting a card by using its retrace ability works just like casting any other spell, with two exceptions: You're casting it from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you must discard a land card in addition to any other costs.
2008/08/01: A retrace card cast from your graveyard follows the normal timing rules for its card type.
2008/08/01: When a retrace card you cast from your graveyard resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered, it's put back into your graveyard. You may use the retrace ability to cast it again.
2008/08/01: If the active player casts a spell that has retrace, that player may cast that card again after it resolves, before another player can remove the card from the graveyard. The active player has priority after the spell resolves, so they can immediately cast a new spell. Since casting a card with retrace from the graveyard moves that card onto the stack, no one else would have the chance to affect it while it's still in the graveyard.
2008/08/01: As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying — or, if that creature is itself a token, the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield — as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on.</Rulings>

<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Multiverseid>500934</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: Tiana's last ability triggers and creates a delayed triggered ability that will let you return the Aura or Equipment during the next end step. It will do so even if Tiana leaves the battlefield before the next end step.
2018/04/27: If an Aura you control is put into a graveyard immediately after Tiana leaves the battlefield, most likely because Tiana left the battlefield but the Aura was put into the graveyard as a state-based action after it found itself not attached to anything, Tiana's last ability won't trigger.
2018/04/27: If an Aura or Equipment you control is put into a graveyard at the same time as Tiana is, most likely because an effect destroyed all nonland permanents, you'll be able to return it to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.
2018/04/27: If an Aura or Equipment is put into your graveyard during an end step, you'll be able to return it during the next end step, not the current one.
2018/04/27: If an Aura or Equipment leaves the graveyard after triggering Tiana's last ability, it won't be returned to its owner's hand as the delayed triggered ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: Urban Evolution's effect allows you to play an additional land during your main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands. In particular, you don't get to play a land as Urban Evolution resolves; Urban Evolution fully resolves first and you draw three cards, perhaps including a land you'll play later.
2018/12/07: The effects of multiple Urban Evolutions in the same turn are cumulative. They're also cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from Explore.
2018/12/07: If you somehow manage to cast Urban Evolution when it's not your turn, you'll draw three cards when it resolves, but you won't be able to play a land that turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Multiverseid>500936</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you're casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can't cast both halves. You'll only be able to cast one half or the other.
2013/04/15: To cast a fused split spell, pay both of its mana costs. While the spell is on the stack, its converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in both costs.
2013/04/15: You can choose the same object as the target of each half of a fused split spell, if appropriate.
2013/04/15: When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets. If all targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. If at least one target is still legal at that time, the spell resolves, but an illegal target can't perform any actions or have any actions performed on it.
2013/04/15: When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half.
2013/04/15: On the stack, a split spell that hasn't been fused has only that half's characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn't exist.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.
2013/04/15: If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.</Rulings>
