2022/04/29: You may sacrifice only one creature to pay a spell's casualty cost, and you copy the spell only once.

2022/04/29: The copy of the spell is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.</Rulings>

2022/04/29: Players may turn face-down creatures face up while a spell with split second is on the stack.
2022/04/29: Split second doesn't stop triggered abilities from triggering, such as that of Chalice of the Void. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
2022/04/29: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
2022/04/29: If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.
2022/04/29: After a spell with split second resolves (or otherwise leaves the stack), players may again cast spells and activate abilities before the next object on the stack resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: Once an ability that causes a creature to connive begins to resolve, no player may take any other actions until it's done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the conniving creature after you discard a nonland card but before it receives a counter.
2022/04/29: If no card is discarded, most likely because that player's hand is empty and an effect says they can't draw cards, the conniving creature does not receive a +1/+1 counter.
2022/04/29: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to connive but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still connives. If you discard a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything. Abilities that trigger "when [that creature] connives" will trigger.
2022/04/29: Connive X is a variant of connive. If a creature connives X, its controller will draw X cards, discard X cards, then then put a number of +1/+1 counters on the conniving permanent equal to the number of nonland cards discarded this way.</Rulings>

2022/04/29: Removing a shield counter in this way isn't the same as regenerating a creature.
2022/04/29: If a permanent that would be dealt damage has more than one shield counter on it, that damage is prevented and only one shield counter is removed.
2022/04/29: If a permanent with a shield counter is dealt unpreventable damage, that damage will be dealt and a shield counter will still be removed.
2022/04/29: A creature with a shield counter on it may still be destroyed by state-based actions if it has damage marked on it equal to its toughness or has been dealt unpreventable damage by a source with deathtouch.
2022/04/29: "Shield" is not an ability that creatures have and shield counters are not keyword counters. If a creature with a shield counter loses its abilities, the shield counter will still protect it as normal.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>598145</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2022/04/29: Escape's permission doesn't change when you may cast the spell from your graveyard.
2022/04/29: The ability Skyway Robber escapes with only allows you to cast cards exiled with its escape ability the last time it escaped. If it dies and escapes again later, or if it moves to another zone and returns to the battlefield, you won't be able to cast any of the cards exiled with it before.
2022/04/29: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an escape cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.
2022/04/29: After an escaped spell resolves, it returns to its owner's graveyard if it's not a permanent spell. If it is a permanent spell, it enters the battlefield and will return to its owner's graveyard if it dies later.
2022/04/29: If a card has multiple abilities giving you permission to cast it, such as two escape abilities or an escape ability and a flashback ability, you choose which one to apply. The others have no effect.
2022/04/29: If you cast a spell with its escape permission, you can't choose to apply any other alternative costs or to cast it without paying its mana cost. If it has any additional costs, you must pay those.
2022/04/29: If a card with escape is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.
2022/04/29: Once you begin casting a spell with escape, it immediately moves to the stack. Players can't take any other actions until you're done casting the spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: You can't tap more creatures to convoke Lethal Scheme than it takes to pay for its total cost. This means that normally no more than four creatures can convoke it.
2022/04/29: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2022/04/29: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or mana value.
2022/04/29: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2022/04/29: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2022/04/29: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2022/04/29: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.
2022/04/29: When multiple creatures are instructed to connive simultaneously, they connive one at a time in the order of their controller's choice.
2022/04/29: Once an ability that causes a creature to connive begins to resolve, no player may take any other actions until it's done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the conniving creature after you discard a nonland card but before it receives a counter.
2022/04/29: If no card is discarded, most likely because that player's hand is empty and an effect says they can't draw cards, the conniving creature does not receive a +1/+1 counter.
2022/04/29: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to connive but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still connives. If you discard a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything. Abilities that trigger "when [that creature] connives" will trigger.</Rulings>

2022/04/29: If you pay the blitz cost to cast a creature spell, that permanent will be sacrificed only if it's still on the battlefield when that triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.

2022/04/29: If the spell with cipher doesn't resolve, none of its effects will happen, including cipher. The card will go to its owner's graveyard and won't be encoded on a creature.

2022/04/29: You cast the copy of the card with cipher during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type.
2022/04/29: If you choose not to cast the copy, or you can't cast it (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy will cease to exist the next time state-based actions are performed. You won't get a chance to cast the copy at a later time.
2022/04/29: The exiled card with cipher grants a triggered ability to the creature it's encoded on. If that creature loses that ability and subsequently deals combat damage to a player, the triggered ability won't trigger. However, the exiled card will continue to be encoded on that creature.
2022/04/29: If another player gains control of the creature, that player will control the triggered ability. That player will create a copy of the encoded card and may cast it.
2022/04/29: If a creature with an encoded card deals combat damage to more than one player simultaneously (perhaps because some of the combat damage was redirected), the triggered ability will trigger once for each player it deals combat damage to.

2022/04/29: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2022/04/29: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2022/04/29: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2022/04/29: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2022/04/29: You can look at a face-down permanent you control any time. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2022/04/29: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2022/04/29: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2022/04/29: There are no cards in this set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2022/04/29: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up.</Rulings>

2022/04/29: If no card is discarded, most likely because that player's hand is empty and an effect says they can't draw cards, the conniving creature does not receive a +1/+1 counter.
2022/04/29: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to connive but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still connives.
