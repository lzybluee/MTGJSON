2020/02/29: You may add in nicknames for the creatures you announce, but you must also get the creature's actual name in there to count. For example, "Gary, the Gray Merchant of Asphodel" is fine, but simply "Gary" wouldn't work.

<Flavor>And yea he doth spake: "Let there be Magic."</Flavor>
<Artist>Dave Dorman</Artist>
<Multiverseid>74250</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/02/29: Richard Garfield, Ph.D. essentially makes you play a variant of the Magic game called "Mental Magic." Here's how the game works. Whenever you cast a spell, you reveal the card to all players and choose any other card (see below for the cards that you can use) that has that card's mana cost. (Note that color very much does matter.) That spell can then be cast as though it was the chosen card. You aren't allowed to choose the same card twice.
2020/02/29: By default, you are limited to cards legal in the format you're playing. If you're playing Draft or Sealed Deck, you can name any card available in the format you're playing. If you're playing with Unsanctioned decks, anything goes. Discuss with your playgroup if you'd prefer to modify or eliminate these limitations.
2020/02/29: Playing cards as though they were other cards is optional.
2020/02/29: Each Richard tracks its own list of played cards. If one leaves the battlefield and another enters, cards previously played under the first Richard are available once again.
2020/02/29: If more than one player controls a Richard Garfield, Ph.D., the cards one player plays has no effect on the other players. For example, each player could play Savannah Lions as a Swords to Plowshares this way.
2020/02/29: The same is true if Richard Garfield, Ph.D. changes controllers. If you play a Savannah Lions as Swords to Plowshares, then an opponent gains control of Richard Garfield, Ph.D., that player can then do the same.</Rulings>

<Artist>David Day</Artist>
<Multiverseid>74331</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/02/29: If the top card of your library is a creature, planeswalker, land, enchantment, or artifact card, it's also on the battlefield. Ta-da! This is, as they say, very weird.
2020/02/29: If the top card of your library is a creature card, it can attack. It does have haste, after all. It can also block.
2020/02/29: If the top card of your library is a permanent card with an activated ability that requires it to be tapped, that ability can be activated. Land cards on top of your library can be tapped for mana, and so on.
2020/02/29: A permanent card that becomes the top card of your library enters the battlefield (unless it went from the battlefield to the top of your library), so any enters-the-battlefield abilities will trigger and "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" abilities will apply. Similarly, a permanent card that stops being the top card of your library leaves the battlefield (unless it went from the top of your library to the battlefield directly).
2020/02/29: If the top card of your library is a creature card and it's put into your graveyard, the creature did die. Note that it wasn't destroyed or sacrificed or anything. It just died. <sad trombone noises>
2020/02/29: If a creature you control that isn't part of your library is put on top of your library, surprisingly little happens, at least at first. That creature doesn't leave or enter the battlefield. It just stays on the battlefield. Of course, now that it's also the top card of your library, you'll probably draw it soon. This is also true if something puts the top card of your library directly onto the battlefield, without you having to play it.
2020/02/29: If the top card is your library is an Aura card, that Aura is on the battlefield not attached to anything. As such, it's put into your graveyard. The new top card of your library is then revealed.
2020/02/29: If you are instructed to draw multiple cards, you draw them one at a time. Each card you draw after the first becomes the top card of your library briefly and is revealed. Each permanent card revealed this way enters and then leaves the battlefield, for any abilities that care about that.</Rulings>

2020/02/29: Pink joins gold and every eye color imaginable in the set of colors in silver-bordered Magic games.
2020/02/29: The pop! counters are considered to be on the inherent tracker in Water Gun Balloon Game's art, not on the permanent itself. Those counters can't be removed or moved to another permanent. Similarly, if you proliferate, you can't add more pop! counters to Water Gun Balloon Game.</Rulings>
