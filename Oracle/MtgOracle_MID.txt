Adeline, Resplendent Cathar's power is equal to the number of creatures you control.
Whenever you attack, for each opponent, create a 1/1 white Human creature token that's tapped and attacking that player or a planeswalker they control.</CardText>
<Artist>Bryan Sola</Artist>
<Multiverseid>534751</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/09/24: The ability that defines Adeline's power works in all zones, not just the battlefield. As long as Adeline is on the battlefield (and still a creature), that ability will count Adeline itself.
2021/09/24: Attacking with any creatures will cause Adeline's last ability to trigger. Adeline doesn't have to be among them.
2021/09/24: Tokens will be created for each of your opponents, not just opponents that you attacked.
2021/09/24: You choose whether each token is attacking that opponent or a planeswalker they control as those tokens enter the battlefield.
2021/09/24: Although the Human tokens created by the triggered ability are attacking, they were never declared as attacking creatures (for the purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/09/24: Disturb is found only on the front faces of some double-faced cards.
2021/09/24: "Disturb [cost]" means "You may cast this card transformed from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost."
2021/09/24: When you cast a spell using a card's disturb ability, the card is put onto the stack with its back face up. The resulting spell has all the characteristics of that face.
2021/09/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a disturb cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of a spell cast using disturb is determined by the mana cost on the front face of the card, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was. (This is a special rule that applies only to transforming double faced-cards, including ones with disturb.)
2021/09/24: A spell cast this way enters the battlefield with its back face up.
2021/09/24: If you copy a permanent spell cast this way (perhaps with a card like Double Major), the copy becomes a token that's a copy of the card's back face, even though it isn't itself a double-faced card.
2021/09/24: The back face of each card with disturb has an ability that instructs its controller to exile if it would be put into a graveyard from anywhere.

2021/09/24: If Brutal Cathar leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield/transforms-into ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2021/09/24: A transforming permanent doesn't leave the battlefield as it transforms. If Brutal Cathar transforms into Moonrage Brute, the exiled cards remain exiled. If it transforms with its triggered ability on the stack, that ability will still exile the target creature.
2021/09/24: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2021/09/24: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2021/09/24: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after this creature leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Clone, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of Brutal Cathar or Moonrage Brute.
2021/09/24: In a multiplayer game, if Brutal Cathar's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.
2021/09/24: For more information about Day and Night and the Daybound and Nightbound abilities, please see the Innistrad: Midnight Hunt Mechanics atricle (https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/innistrad-midnight-hunt-mechanics-2021-09-02).
2021/09/24: Double-faced permanents with daybound transform to their nightbound faces as it becomes night. Similarly, double-faced permanents with nightbound transform to their daybound faces as it becomes day. This happens immediately and is not a state-based action. It happens any time it becomes day or night, not just during the untap step.
2021/09/24: If you cast a spell with daybound during night, that spell will be front face up (that is, daybound face up) on the stack. However, it will enter the battlefield with its back face up (that is, with its nightbound face up). It won't enter with its daybound face up and then transform.
2021/09/24: If it is night, permanents with daybound that enter the battlefield without being cast will enter with their nightbound faces up.
2021/09/24: Permanents with daybound and nightbound can't transform via any means other than their daybound and nightbound abilities. Notably, older cards such as Moonmist that instruct a player to transform permanents don't affect permanents with daybound or nightbound.
2021/09/24: If it's neither day nor night, and a creature with daybound and a creature with nightbound somehow appear on the battlefield at the same time, it becomes day. The creature with nightbound will transform.

<CardText>If it's neither day nor night, it becomes day as Celestus Sanctifier enters the battlefield.

<Artist>Irina Nordsol</Artist>
<Multiverseid>534766</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/09/24: The card you don't put into your graveyard stays on top of your library.
2021/09/24: If a triggered ability triggers whenever day becomes night or night becomes day, it only triggers if it was already either day/night and becomes the other. It does not trigger when the game becomes day or night for the first time.
2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.
2021/09/24: For more information about Day and Night and the Daybound and Nightbound abilities, please see the Innistrad: Midnight Hunt Mechanics atricle (https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/innistrad-midnight-hunt-mechanics-2021-09-02).</Rulings>

2021/09/24: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.

This means that the replacement effect will be applied again if your life total would be reduced to 0 or less a second time while that copy effect is still applied.

<Rulings>2021/09/24: Disturb is found only on the front faces of some double-faced cards.
2021/09/24: "Disturb [cost]" means "You may cast this card transformed from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost."
2021/09/24: When you cast a spell using a card's disturb ability, the card is put onto the stack with its back face up. The resulting spell has all the characteristics of that face.
2021/09/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a disturb cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of a spell cast using disturb is determined by the mana cost on the front face of the card, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was. (This is a special rule that applies only to transforming double faced-cards, including ones with disturb.)
2021/09/24: A spell cast this way enters the battlefield with its back face up.
2021/09/24: If you copy a permanent spell cast this way (perhaps with a card like Double Major), the copy becomes a token that's a copy of the card's back face, even though it isn't itself a double-faced card.
2021/09/24: The back face of each card with disturb has an ability that instructs its controller to exile if it would be put into a graveyard from anywhere. This includes going to the graveyard from the stack, so if the spell is countered after you cast it using the disturb ability, it will be put into exile.</Rulings>

2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.

2021/09/24: The back face of each card with disturb has an ability that instructs its controller to exile if it would be put into a graveyard from anywhere. This includes going to the graveyard from the stack, so if the spell is countered after you cast it using the disturb ability, it will be put into exile.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/09/24: If a triggered ability triggers whenever day becomes night or night becomes day, it only triggers if it was already either day/night and becomes the other. It does not trigger when the game becomes day or night for the first time.
2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.

<Rulings>2021/09/24: Memory Deluge cares about the mana you actually paid to cast it, not its mana cost. If you cast Memory Deluge for {2}{U}{U}, you will look at four cards. If you cast it with flashback for {5}{U}{U}, you will look at seven cards. Any effects that increase or decrease the cost to cast it will also be taken into account.
2021/09/24: If Memory Deluge is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so X will be 0. The amount of mana spent to cast the original spell is not copied. You won't look at any cards from your library as Memory Deluge resolves.
2021/09/24: If an effect allows you to cast Memory Deluge without paying its mana cost, X will be 0. Memory Deluge will resolve, but you won't do anything.
2021/09/24: If an effect requires you to pay some amount of mana to prevent Memory Deluge from being countered, as Flip the Switch does, that mana wasn't spent to cast Memory Deluge and will not be taken into account.
2021/09/24: The effects of Might of the Old Ways happen in the listed order, so the +2/+2 bonus happens before you check the powers of creatures you control. For example, if you control two 2/2 creatures and a 5/5 creatures, choosing one of the 2/2 creatures as the target will allow you to draw a card. Conversely, if you control a 1/1 creature, a 3/3 creature, and a 5/5 creature, targeting either of the two smaller creatures will not allow you to draw a card.
2021/09/24: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/09/24: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/09/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/09/24: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/09/24: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.
2021/09/24: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</Rulings>

When Spectral Adversary enters the battlefield, you may pay {1}{U} any number of times. When you pay this cost one or more times, put that many +1/+1 counters on Spectral Adversary, then up to that many other target artifacts, creatures, and/or enchantments phase out.</CardText>
<Artist>Uriah Voth</Artist>
<Multiverseid>534843</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/09/24: After you pay the {1}{U} cost one or more times, a second ability triggers and you choose the targets for it. Players may respond to the new ability at that point. As that ability resolves, Spectral Adversary gets its +1/+1 counters and the target permanents phase out.
2021/09/24: Permanents that are phased out are treated as though they don't exist. They can't be the target of spells or abilities, their static abilities have no effect on the game, their triggered abilities can't trigger, they can't attack or block, and so on.
2021/09/24: As a permanent phases out, Auras and Equipment attached to it also phase out at the same time. Those Auras and Equipment will phase in at the same time that permanent does, and they'll phase in still attached to that permanent.
2021/09/24: Permanents phase back in during their controller's untap step, immediately before that player untaps their permanents. Creatures that phase in this way are able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn. If a permanent had counters on it when it phased out, it will have those counters when it phases back in.
2021/09/24: An attacking or blocking creature that phases out is removed from combat.
2021/09/24: Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
2021/09/24: Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration ignore phased-out objects. If ignoring those objects causes the effect's conditions to no longer be met, the duration will expire. For example, phasing out Mind Flayer will cause the duration of its continuous effect ("for as long as you control Mind Flayer") to expire.
2021/09/24: Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
2021/09/24: If an opponent gains control of one of your permanents, that permanent phases out, and the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases back in, that permanent phases in under your control as that opponent's next untap step begins. If they leave the game before their next untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after their turn would have begun.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/09/24: Decayed represents a static ability and a triggered ability. "Decayed" means "This creature can't block" and "When this creature attacks, sacrifice it at end of combat."
2021/09/24: Decayed does not create any attacking requirements. You may choose not to attack with a creature that has decayed.
2021/09/24: Decayed does not grant haste. Creatures with decayed that enter the battlefield during your turn may not attack until your next turn.
2021/09/24: Once a creature with decayed attacks, it will be sacrificed at end of combat, even if it no longer has decayed at that time.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>534846</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.
2021/09/24: For more information about Day and Night and the Daybound and Nightbound abilities, please see the Innistrad: Midnight Hunt Mechanics atricle (https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/innistrad-midnight-hunt-mechanics-2021-09-02).
2021/09/24: Double-faced permanents with daybound transform to their nightbound faces as it becomes night. Similarly, double-faced permanents with nightbound transform to their daybound faces as it becomes day. This happens immediately and is not a state-based action. It happens any time it becomes day or night, not just during the untap step.
2021/09/24: If you cast a spell with daybound during night, that spell will be front face up (that is, daybound face up) on the stack. However, it will enter the battlefield with its back face up (that is, with its nightbound face up). It won't enter with its daybound face up and then transform.
2021/09/24: If it is night, permanents with daybound that enter the battlefield without being cast will enter with their nightbound faces up.
2021/09/24: Permanents with daybound and nightbound can't transform via any means other than their daybound and nightbound abilities. Notably, older cards such as Moonmist that instruct a player to transform permanents don't affect permanents with daybound or nightbound.
2021/09/24: If it's neither day nor night, and a creature with daybound and a creature with nightbound somehow appear on the battlefield at the same time, it becomes day. The creature with nightbound will transform.</Rulings>

2021/09/24: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/09/24: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.
2021/09/24: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/09/24: Attaching Curse of Leeches as it transforms doesn't target a player, so it can be attached to a player with hexproof this way.
2021/09/24: After Curse of Leeches transforms into Leeching Lurker, it will become unattached from the player it's attached to as a state-based action.
2021/09/24: If you cast Curse of Leeches while it is night, you must still choose a target player, and that player must be a legal target as Curse of Leeches resolves. It enters the battlefield transformed and is not attached to that player.
2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.
2021/09/24: For more information about Day and Night and the Daybound and Nightbound abilities, please see the Innistrad: Midnight Hunt Mechanics atricle (https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/innistrad-midnight-hunt-mechanics-2021-09-02).
2021/09/24: Double-faced permanents with daybound transform to their nightbound faces as it becomes night. Similarly, double-faced permanents with nightbound transform to their daybound faces as it becomes day. This happens immediately and is not a state-based action. It happens any time it becomes day or night, not just during the untap step.
2021/09/24: If you cast a spell with daybound during night, that spell will be front face up (that is, daybound face up) on the stack. However, it will enter the battlefield with its back face up (that is, with its nightbound face up). It won't enter with its daybound face up and then transform.
2021/09/24: If it is night, permanents with daybound that enter the battlefield without being cast will enter with their nightbound faces up.
2021/09/24: Permanents with daybound and nightbound can't transform via any means other than their daybound and nightbound abilities. Notably, older cards such as Moonmist that instruct a player to transform permanents don't affect permanents with daybound or nightbound.
2021/09/24: If it's neither day nor night, and a creature with daybound and a creature with nightbound somehow appear on the battlefield at the same time, it becomes day. The creature with nightbound will transform.
2021/09/24: If Leeching Lurker is on the battlefield during night, and the active player casts two or more spells during the turn, it will become day as the next turn begins. This will cause Leeching Lurker to transform into Curse of Leeches and become attached to a player. This all happens before that turn's upkeep, so the triggered ability of Curse of Leeches will trigger at the beginning of that turn's upkeep.</Rulings>

2021/09/24: If you cast a spell with daybound during night, that spell will be front face up (that is, daybound face up) on the stack. However, it will enter the battlefield with its back face up (that is, with its nightbound face up). It won't enter with its daybound face up and then transform.
2021/09/24: If it is night, permanents with daybound that enter the battlefield without being cast will enter with their nightbound faces up.

2021/09/24: Permanents with daybound and nightbound can't transform via any means other than their daybound and nightbound abilities. Notably, older cards such as Moonmist that instruct a player to transform permanents don't affect permanents with daybound or nightbound.
2021/09/24: If it's neither day nor night, and a creature with daybound and a creature with nightbound somehow appear on the battlefield at the same time, it becomes day. The creature with nightbound will transform.</Rulings>

2021/09/24: If you cast Seize the Storm with no instant or sorcery cards in your graveyard and no cards with flashback in exile, the Elemental will start as a 0/0 creature. However, state-based actions won't be checked until after Seize the Storm has finished resolving. The Elemental will then be a 1/1 creature and survive because Seize the Storm will either be in your graveyard or in exile.
2021/09/24: While a spell is on the stack, it is neither in your graveyard nor in exile, so it won't contribute to the Elemental's power and toughness.

2021/09/24: Double-faced permanents with daybound transform to their nightbound faces as it becomes night. Similarly, double-faced permanents with nightbound transform to their daybound faces as it becomes day. This happens immediately and is not a state-based action. It happens any time it becomes day or night, not just during the untap step.
2021/09/24: If you cast a spell with daybound during night, that spell will be front face up (that is, daybound face up) on the stack. However, it will enter the battlefield with its back face up (that is, with its nightbound face up). It won't enter with its daybound face up and then transform.
2021/09/24: If it is night, permanents with daybound that enter the battlefield without being cast will enter with their nightbound faces up.
2021/09/24: Permanents with daybound and nightbound can't transform via any means other than their daybound and nightbound abilities. Notably, older cards such as Moonmist that instruct a player to transform permanents don't affect permanents with daybound or nightbound.

<Artist>Billy Christian</Artist>
<Multiverseid>534952</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/09/24: Augur of Autumn doesn't change the times when you can play a land card from the top of your library. You can play a land only during your main phase when you have priority and the stack is empty. Doing so counts as your land play for the turn.
2021/09/24: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't suspend it, cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2021/09/24: Essentially, Augur of Autumn lets you play with the top card of your library revealed only to you. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand. You may look at the top card of your library whenever you want, even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack.
2021/09/24: If the top card of your library changes during the process of casting a spell or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until the process of casting the spell or activating the ability ends (all targets are chosen, all costs are paid, and so on).
2021/09/24: While you have three creatures with different powers, Augur of Autumn allows you to cast the top card of your library if it's a creature card, it's your main phase, and the stack is empty. If that creature card has flash, you'll be able to cast it any time you could cast an instant, even on an opponent's turn.
2021/09/24: You still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs.
2021/09/24: A creature has different power from another if their powers are different numbers. For example, a 1/1 creature and a 2/1 creature have different powers.
2021/09/24: For three creatures to have different powers from one another, each of their powers needs to be different. A 1/1 creature, a 2/1 creature, and another 2/1 creature aren't three creatures with different powers, even though both 2/1 creatures have different power than the 1/1 creature.
2021/09/24: Many coven abilities, such as that of Dawnhart Wardens above, are triggered abilities with intervening if clauses. You must control three or more creatures with different powers at the time the ability triggers and at the time the ability tries to resolve. They do not, however, need to be the same set of creatures in both cases.</Rulings>

2021/09/24: Permanents with daybound and nightbound can't transform via any means other than their daybound and nightbound abilities. Notably, older cards such as Moonmist that instruct a player to transform permanents don't affect permanents with daybound or nightbound.

<Rulings>2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.

2021/09/24: Double-faced permanents with daybound transform to their nightbound faces as it becomes night.

<Rulings>2021/09/24: The ability that defines Consuming Blob's power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield. If Consuming Blob is in your graveyard, it will count itself.
2021/09/24: Consuming Blob counts card types, not individual cards. If the only card in your graveyard is an artifact creature card, Consuming Blob will be 2/3. If the only cards in your graveyard are ten artifact creature cards, Consuming Blob will still be 2/3.
2021/09/24: The card types in this set that can be in a graveyard are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, and sorcery. Some older cards also have the card type tribal. Legendary, basic, and snow are supertypes, not card types.
2021/09/24: If an instant or sorcery spell deals damage to Consuming Blob or reduces its toughness to 0, that spell is put into its owner's graveyard before state-based actions are performed. If that card is the first of its type to enter the graveyard of Consuming Blob's controller, it will raise Consuming Blob's toughness before the game checks to see if it dies.
2021/09/24: The above rulings are also true for Consuming Blob's children (except the first one, as Junior tends to not hang out in graveyards).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.
2021/09/24: For more information about Day and Night and the Daybound and Nightbound abilities, please see the Innistrad: Midnight Hunt Mechanics atricle (https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/innistrad-midnight-hunt-mechanics-2021-09-02).
2021/09/24: Double-faced permanents with daybound transform to their nightbound faces as it becomes night. Similarly, double-faced permanents with nightbound transform to their daybound faces as it becomes day. This happens immediately and is not a state-based action. It happens any time it becomes day or night, not just during the untap step.
2021/09/24: If you cast a spell with daybound during night, that spell will be front face up (that is, daybound face up) on the stack. However, it will enter the battlefield with its back face up (that is, with its nightbound face up). It won't enter with its daybound face up and then transform.
2021/09/24: If it is night, permanents with daybound that enter the battlefield without being cast will enter with their nightbound faces up.
2021/09/24: Permanents with daybound and nightbound can't transform via any means other than their daybound and nightbound abilities. Notably, older cards such as Moonmist that instruct a player to transform permanents don't affect permanents with daybound or nightbound.
2021/09/24: If it's neither day nor night, and a creature with daybound and a creature with nightbound somehow appear on the battlefield at the same time, it becomes day. The creature with nightbound will transform.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/09/24: A creature has different power from another if their powers are different numbers. For example, a 1/1 creature and a 2/1 creature have different powers.
2021/09/24: For three creatures to have different powers from one another, each of their powers needs to be different. A 1/1 creature, a 2/1 creature, and another 2/1 creature aren't three creatures with different powers, even though both 2/1 creatures have different power than the 1/1 creature.
2021/09/24: Many coven abilities, such as that of Dawnhart Wardens above, are triggered abilities with intervening if clauses. You must control three or more creatures with different powers at the time the ability triggers and at the time the ability tries to resolve. They do not, however, need to be the same set of creatures in both cases.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/09/24: If an effect instructs you to "double" a creature's power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is its power as that effect begins to apply. Similarly, a creature whose toughness is doubled gets +0/+X, where X is its toughness as the effect begins to apply.
2021/09/24: If a creature's power is less than 0 when it's doubled, instead that creature gets -X/-0, where X is how much less than 0 its power is. For example, if an effect has given Bear Cub, a 2/2 creature, -4/-0 so that it's a -2/2 creature, doubling its power and toughness gives it -2/+2, and it becomes a -4/4 creature.
2021/09/24: If you control more than one Unnatural Growth, each one applies independently. For example, if you control two copies of Unnatural Growth, a 2/2 Bear Cub becomes a 4/4 creature when the first ability resolves and then becomes an 8/8 creature when the second one resolves.</Rulings>

2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.
2021/09/24: For more information about Day and Night and the Daybound and Nightbound abilities, please see the Innistrad: Midnight Hunt Mechanics atricle (https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/innistrad-midnight-hunt-mechanics-2021-09-02).
2021/09/24: Double-faced permanents with daybound transform to their nightbound faces as it becomes night. Similarly, double-faced permanents with nightbound transform to their daybound faces as it becomes day. This happens immediately and is not a state-based action. It happens any time it becomes day or night, not just during the untap step.
2021/09/24: If you cast a spell with daybound during night, that spell will be front face up (that is, daybound face up) on the stack. However, it will enter the battlefield with its back face up (that is, with its nightbound face up). It won't enter with its daybound face up and then transform.
2021/09/24: If it is night, permanents with daybound that enter the battlefield without being cast will enter with their nightbound faces up.
2021/09/24: Permanents with daybound and nightbound can't transform via any means other than their daybound and nightbound abilities. Notably, older cards such as Moonmist that instruct a player to transform permanents don't affect permanents with daybound or nightbound.
2021/09/24: If it's neither day nor night, and a creature with daybound and a creature with nightbound somehow appear on the battlefield at the same time, it becomes day. The creature with nightbound will transform.
2021/09/24: After Arlinn, the Moon Fury's second loyalty ability resolves, she is a Werewolf creature and not a planeswalker, so she doesn't lose loyalty counters when she's dealt damage.
2021/09/24: If Arlinn, the Moon Fury's second loyalty ability is making her a Werewolf creature and it somehow becomes day, Arlinn will transform, but the effect making her a Werewolf creature will continue to apply for the rest of the turn.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/09/24: The second ability of Dennick, Pious Apprentice affects only spells and abilities that actually target cards in graveyards. Spells and abilities that affect cards in graveyards without targeting them may still affect them, move them to other zones, and so on.
2021/09/24: Disturb is found only on the front faces of some double-faced cards.
2021/09/24: "Disturb [cost]" means "You may cast this card transformed from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost."
2021/09/24: When you cast a spell using a card's disturb ability, the card is put onto the stack with its back face up. The resulting spell has all the characteristics of that face.
2021/09/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a disturb cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of a spell cast using disturb is determined by the mana cost on the front face of the card, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was. (This is a special rule that applies only to transforming double faced-cards, including ones with disturb.)
2021/09/24: A spell cast this way enters the battlefield with its back face up.
2021/09/24: If you copy a permanent spell cast this way (perhaps with a card like Double Major), the copy becomes a token that's a copy of the card's back face, even though it isn't itself a double-faced card.
2021/09/24: The back face of each card with disturb has an ability that instructs its controller to exile if it would be put into a graveyard from anywhere. This includes going to the graveyard from the stack, so if the spell is countered after you cast it using the disturb ability, it will be put into exile.
2021/09/24: The triggered ability of Dennick, Pious Apparition looks at what type the cards are after they move to the graveyard to determine whether the ability should trigger, regardless of any types they may have had before they were in the graveyard. For example, a creature card that has become a noncreature permanent, perhaps because it was enchanted by Minimus Containment, will cause the ability to trigger when it's put into a graveyard. By contrast, a noncreature card that has become a creature on the battlefield will not cause the ability to trigger when it's put into a graveyard.
2021/09/24: A token dying will never cause the triggered ability to trigger because a token is not a card.</Rulings>

2021/09/24: You get a postcombat main phase even if no creatures attacked during a turn. Florian's last ability will trigger.
2021/09/24: If an opponent loses life but Florian leaves the battlefield before your postcombat main phase begins, its last ability doesn't trigger.
2021/09/24: Florian's ability checks only how much life opponents lost during the turn, not by how much their life totals decreased compared to the start of the turn. For example, if an opponent lost 2 life and then gained 8 life before Florian's ability resolves, you'll look at the top two cards of your library.
2021/09/24: If an opponent loses life and subsequently loses the game before your postcombat main phase, Florian's last ability counts that loss of life.
2021/09/24: If you somehow have more than two main phases in a turn, each main phase after your first one is a postcombat main phase, and Florian's last ability triggers at the beginning of each of them.

<Rulings>2021/09/24: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.
2021/09/24: If you resolve one Galvanic Iteration after another (or cast the same one with flashback), the second Galvanic Iteration will be copied. That copy and spell each resolve, creating two delayed triggered abilities. The next spell you cast after that will be copied twice. If that spell is also a Galvanic Iteration, the following spell will be copied three times, and so on.
2021/09/24: Galvanic Iteration's ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2021/09/24: A copy is created even if the spell that caused Galvanic Iteration's ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2021/09/24: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. The new targets must be legal.
2021/09/24: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
2021/09/24: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy has the same value of X.
2021/09/24: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2021/09/24: The copy that Galvanic Iteration's ability creates is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2021/09/24: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."

<Rulings>2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.

2021/09/24: Double-faced permanents with daybound transform to their nightbound faces as it becomes night. Similarly, double-faced permanents with nightbound transform to their daybound faces as it becomes day. This happens immediately and is not a state-based action. It happens any time it becomes day or night, not just during the untap step.
2021/09/24: If you cast a spell with daybound during night, that spell will be front face up (that is, daybound face up) on the stack. However, it will enter the battlefield with its back face up (that is, with its nightbound face up). It won't enter with its daybound face up and then transform.
2021/09/24: If it is night, permanents with daybound that enter the battlefield without being cast will enter with their nightbound faces up.

<Rulings>2021/09/24: The ability that defines the power and toughness of Old Stickfingers functions in all zones, not only while Old Stickfingers is on the battlefield. While Old Stickfingers is in a graveyard, the ability will count Old Stickfingers itself, presumably using a single, withered stickfinger.
2021/09/24: The triggered ability will resolve before Old Stickfingers does. If Old Stickfingers is countered in response to its own triggered ability, you will still follow all the instructions of the triggered ability, using the chosen value of X.</Rulings>

If a spell would deal damage to you or another permanent you control, prevent that damage.
If a spell would deal damage to an opponent or a permanent an opponent controls, it deals that much damage plus 1 instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Francisco Miyara</Artist>
<Multiverseid>535031</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/09/24: Rem Karolus, Stalwart Slayer's last two abilities apply only to damage dealt by spells on the stack. A spell that becomes a permanent and then deals damage won't be affected.
2021/09/24: Some spells cause other objects to deal damage, such as spells that cause two creatures to fight. Rem Karolus, Stalwart Slayer's last two abilities don't apply to damage from such effects.
2021/09/24: The additional 1 damage is dealt by the original source of damage. The additional damage isn't dealt by Rem Karolus.
2021/09/24: If another effect modifies how much damage a spell would deal to an opponent or a permanent they control, including preventing some of it, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses an order in which to apply those effects. If all of the damage is prevented, Rem's effect no longer applies.
2021/09/24: If damage dealt by a source you control is being divided or assigned among multiple permanents an opponent controls or among an opponent and one or more permanents they control, divide the original amount before adding 1. For example, if you cast a spell that deals 4 damage divided among any number of targets and you choose to have it deal 2 damage to a creature and 2 damage to that creature's controller, that spell will deal 3 damage to each of them instead.</Rulings>

<CardText>If it's neither day nor night, it becomes day as Vadrik, Astral Archmage enters the battlefield.
Instant and sorcery spells you cast cost {X} less to cast, where X is Vadrik's power.
Whenever day becomes night or night becomes day, put a +1/+1 counter on Vadrik.</CardText>
<Artist>Kieran Yanner</Artist>
<Multiverseid>535045</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/09/24: All costs to cast a spell are locked in before mana abilities are activated and those costs are paid. If Vadrik's power changes after costs are locked in, or if Vadrik leaves the battlefield while you are activating mana abilities or paying those costs, the cost reduction effect won't be affected and the total cost to cast the spell won't change.
2021/09/24: If a triggered ability triggers whenever day becomes night or night becomes day, it only triggers if it was already either day/night and becomes the other. It does not trigger when the game becomes day or night for the first time.
2021/09/24: Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts as neither. Once the game becomes day (or less commonly, night), the game will be exactly one of them—day or night—going back and forth for the rest of the game.
2021/09/24: Before a player untaps their permanents during the untap step, the game checks to see if the day/night designation should change.
2021/09/24: If it is day, and the active player of the previous turn cast no spells during their turn, it becomes night.
2021/09/24: If it is night, and the active player of the previous turn cast two or more spells during their turn, it becomes day.
