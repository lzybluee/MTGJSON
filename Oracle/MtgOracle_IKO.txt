<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479544</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: If you control a permanent with more than one type, you may choose it for each of those types. For example, you could choose an artifact creature as the artifact you keep and also as the creature you keep.
2020/04/17: If you're choosing the permanents for each player, your choices must still be legal. For example, you can't decline to choose a creature a player will keep if that player controls a creature.
2020/04/17: As Mythos of Snapdax resolves, first you choose which permanents you control won't be sacrificed, then each other player in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then each nonland permanent not chosen is sacrificed at the same time.
2020/04/17: Lands with another permanent type can't be chosen and won't be sacrificed.
2020/04/17: The abilities of the Mythos check what colors of mana were spent to cast the spell. It's not an alternative cost to cast the spell.
2020/04/17: If an effect copies the Mythos spell, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the copy won't receive the bonus.
2020/04/17: The ability checks what mana was actually spent to cast a spell. If an effect allows you to spend mana "as though it were mana" of any color or type, that allows you to spend mana you couldn't otherwise spend, but it doesn't change what mana you spent to cast the spell.
2020/04/17: If an effect allows you to cast a spell without paying its mana cost, you can't choose to cast it and pay unless another rule or effect allows you to cast that spell for a cost. Similarly, you can't waive a cost reduction unless that effect says you may.</Rulings>

2020/04/17: If a creature has power and toughness written as */* with an ability that defines its power and toughness, its base power and toughness become 0/0 when it loses all abilities. Mystic Subdual then makes it a -2/0. If its power and toughness are written as */*+1, it's -2/1, and so on.
2020/04/17: Mutating the enchanted creature won't cause it to gain abilities. This is because mutate modifies the creature's base characteristics, while Mystic Subdual applies to the resulting creature.</Rulings>

<CardText>Create a token that's a copy of target permanent. If {R}{G} was spent to cast this spell, instead create a token that's a copy of that permanent, except the token has "When this permanent enters the battlefield, if it's a creature, it fights up to one target creature you don't control."</CardText>
<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479578</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: The token copies exactly what is printed on the permanent and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2020/04/17: If the copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2020/04/17: If the copied permanent is copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that permanent is copying.
2020/04/17: If the copied permanent is itself a token, the token created by Mythos of Illuna copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
2020/04/17: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[This permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied permanent will also work.
2020/04/17: If an Aura is put onto the battlefield without being cast, such as by being created as a token, the Aura's controller-to-be chooses what it will enchant as it enters the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to an opponent's permanent with hexproof, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If an Aura token can't legally be attached to anything, it isn't created.
2020/04/17: If {R}{G} was spent to cast the spell, the token has the extra ability. If something copies the token later, the copy will also have that ability.
2020/04/17: If the token isn't a creature immediately after it enters the battlefield, the granted ability won't trigger. You can't take actions to make that token into a creature after it has entered the battlefield.
2020/04/17: If the target creature is an illegal target or if the token is no longer a creature when the token's granted ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. If it's a legal target but the token is no longer on the battlefield when the ability resolves, the target creature won't deal or be dealt damage.
2020/04/17: The abilities of the Mythos check what colors of mana were spent to cast the spell. It's not an alternative cost to cast the spell.
2020/04/17: If an effect copies the Mythos spell, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the copy won't receive the bonus.
2020/04/17: The ability checks what mana was actually spent to cast a spell. If an effect allows you to spend mana "as though it were mana" of any color or type, that allows you to spend mana you couldn't otherwise spend, but it doesn't change what mana you spent to cast the spell.
2020/04/17: If an effect allows you to cast a spell without paying its mana cost, you can't choose to cast it and pay unless another rule or effect allows you to cast that spell for a cost. Similarly, you can't waive a cost reduction unless that effect says you may.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/04/17: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Of One Mind). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2020/04/17: Once you announce that you're casting Of One Mind, no player may take actions until the spell has been paid for. Notably, opponents can't try to change whether you control a Human and a non-Human creature.

2020/04/17: You can choose 0 as the value of X in Shark Typhoon's cycling cost. The last ability will trigger, and you'll create a 0/0 blue Shark creature token with flying. Unless something else is raising its toughness, the Shark will then immediately die.
2020/04/17: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them, and some cards have an ability that triggers whenever you cycle any card. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2020/04/17: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2020/04/17: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate.

Then all the chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.</Rulings>

2020/04/17: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate.

<Multiverseid>479637</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: Excess damage caused by a spell or ability is similar to how combat damage from a creature with trample is handled. Start with the amount of damage being dealt to the creature and determine what is "lethal." This is the creature's toughness minus the amount of damage that it already has marked on it, but ignoring any replacement or prevention effects that will modify this damage. Also ignore whether the creature has an ability such as indestructible that will result in it not being destroyed by this damage.
2020/04/17: Once you've determined how much damage is excess, Flame Spill simultaneously deals damage to the creature and to its controller. This damage may be modified by replacement or prevention effects.
2020/04/17: If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Flame Spill tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. It won't deal damage to any player.</Rulings>

2020/04/17: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by Mythos of Vadrok.
2020/04/17: The target creatures and planeswalkers will be unable to attack, block, or have their abilities activated even if the damage that would be dealt to them is prevented. However, if one of those permanents becomes an illegal target, it will be able to attack, block, and have its abilities activated.
2020/04/17: The abilities of the Mythos check what colors of mana were spent to cast the spell. It's not an alternative cost to cast the spell.
2020/04/17: If an effect copies the Mythos spell, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the copy won't receive the bonus.
2020/04/17: The ability checks what mana was actually spent to cast a spell. If an effect allows you to spend mana "as though it were mana" of any color or type, that allows you to spend mana you couldn't otherwise spend, but it doesn't change what mana you spent to cast the spell.
2020/04/17: If an effect allows you to cast a spell without paying its mana cost, you can't choose to cast it and pay unless another rule or effect allows you to cast that spell for a cost. Similarly, you can't waive a cost reduction unless that effect says you may.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/04/17: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Tentative Connection). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2020/04/17: Once you announce that you're casting Tentative Connection, no player may take actions until the spell has been paid for. Notably, opponents can't try to change whether you control a creature with menace.
2020/04/17: Tentative Connection is unaffected if you no longer control a creature with menace after you've cast it. You won't have to pay an additional {3}.
2020/04/17: Tentative Connection can target any creature, even one that you already control or that is already untapped.</Rulings>

2020/04/17: If the cycled card has multiple card types, you stop when you exile a card that shares any of those types. You don't exile card to find one that shares all of its types, and you can't choose to keep going to find a different one of those types.
2020/04/17: If you exile your entire library without exiling a card that shares a card type, you put the library back in a random order and continue. You won't draw a card.

2020/04/17: If you cycle Yidaro but it isn't in your graveyard as the triggered ability resolves, you can't put it onto the battlefield or shuffle it into your library. You'll still shuffle your library if you haven't cycled Yidaro four times this game.
2020/04/17: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them, and some cards have an ability that triggers whenever you cycle any card. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2020/04/17: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2020/04/17: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability is countered (with Disallow, for example), the other ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains in its current zone.
2020/04/17: An Aura being put onto the battlefield this way can't enchant anything else that is being put onto the battlefield at the same time.

<Rulings>2020/04/17: If the second target creature can't block the first target creature for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having it block the creature, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to block in that case either. That creature is free to block another creature or to not block at all.
2020/04/17: If a creature is required to block a creature with menace, another creature must also block that creature if able. If none can, the creature that's required to block can block another creature or not block at all.
2020/04/17: Creatures other than the second target creature may still block the first target creature if able.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/04/17: Because Mythos of Brokkos doesn't target the permanent cards in your graveyard, you may choose the card you searched for.
2020/04/17: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2020/04/17: The abilities of the Mythos check what colors of mana were spent to cast the spell. It's not an alternative cost to cast the spell.
2020/04/17: If an effect copies the Mythos spell, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the copy won't receive the bonus.
2020/04/17: The ability checks what mana was actually spent to cast a spell. If an effect allows you to spend mana "as though it were mana" of any color or type, that allows you to spend mana you couldn't otherwise spend, but it doesn't change what mana you spent to cast the spell.
2020/04/17: If an effect allows you to cast a spell without paying its mana cost, you can't choose to cast it and pay unless another rule or effect allows you to cast that spell for a cost. Similarly, you can't waive a cost reduction unless that effect says you may.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>479690</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: If either creature is an illegal target as Ram Through tries to resolve, the creature you control won't deal damage to any creature or player.
2020/04/17: Excess damage caused by a spell or ability is similar to how combat damage from a creature with trample is handled. Start with the amount of damage being dealt to the creature and determine what is "lethal." This is the creature's toughness minus the amount of damage that it already has marked on it, but ignoring any replacement or prevention effects that will modify this damage. Also ignore whether the creature has an ability such as indestructible that will result in it not being destroyed by this damage.
2020/04/17: If the target creature you control has deathtouch, 1 damage from it is lethal.
2020/04/17: Once you've determined how much damage is excess, the creature you control simultaneously deals damage to the creature and to its controller. This damage may be modified by replacement or prevention effects.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/04/17: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them, and some cards have an ability that triggers whenever you cycle any card. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2020/04/17: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2020/04/17: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability is countered (with Disallow, for example), the other ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

<Artist>Lius Lasahido</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479695</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish doing so. This means that if you cast the top card of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
2020/04/17: Vivien lets you look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction; see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
2020/04/17: Normally, Vivien allows you to cast the top card of your library if it's a creature card, it's your main phase, and the stack is empty. If that creature card has flash, you'll be able to cast it any time you could cast an instant, even on an opponent's turn.
2020/04/17: You'll still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs such as mutate costs.
2020/04/17: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2020/04/17: After activating Vivien's last loyalty ability, the delayed triggered ability it creates will put a creature card onto the battlefield before the creature spell that caused the ability to trigger resolves.
2020/04/17: For spells with {X} in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine the spell's converted mana cost.
2020/04/17: If a card in a player's library has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2020/04/17: If you cast a mutating creature spell, you must choose a target for it before the triggered ability from Vivien's last ability puts a creature onto the battlefield. The creature you find can't be the target of the mutating creature spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/04/17: As you cast Back for More, it targets only a creature card in your graveyard. While the spell is resolving, you return the target card to the battlefield. When you do, the reflexive triggered ability triggers and you pick a target to fight. This is different from effects that say "If you do . . ." in that you can return a creature card to the battlefield without a legal target to fight.
2020/04/17: The reflexive triggered ability from Back for More is put onto the stack at the same time as any other triggered abilities caused by the creature entering the battlefield.
2020/04/17: If the target creature is an illegal target when the reflexive triggered ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve.

<Artist>Slawomir Maniak</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479717</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: Nethroi's triggered ability can return any combination of creatures whose powers total 10 or less. For example, it could target ten 1/1 creature cards, two 5/5 creature cards, and so on. Regardless of what other creature cards you choose as targets, you can also choose any number of creature cards with power 0 as targets.
2020/04/17: Use the power of the creature cards as they exist in your graveyard to determine whether they can be the targets of Nethroi's triggered ability. For example, a 0/0 creature card that will enter the battlefield as a copy of a 15/15 creature can be returned, as can five 0/0 creature cards that will each enter the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on them.
2020/04/17: If the power of the target creature cards change while in your graveyard, most likely because one has a characteristic-defining ability that defines a * in its power, the total power of the creatures may become greater than 10. If this happens, the entire selection of targets is illegal and nothing is returned to the battlefield.</Rulings>

2020/04/17: The token's power and toughness are 1/1. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy. If the copied card has an ability that defines its power or toughness, that ability isn't copied. On the other hand, gaining haste after the token has been created is not a copiable value.
2020/04/17: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created.

2020/04/17: Cunning Nightbonder's last ability doesn't apply to itself while it's a spell.
2020/04/17: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Cunning Nightbonder). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2020/04/17: Cunning Nightbonder's cost reduction applies only to generic mana in a spell's cost. It can't reduce a spell's colored mana requirements. For example, your first Cunning Nightbonder won't normally reduce the cost of your second since it has no generic mana in its cost.
2020/04/17: A spell or ability that counters spells can still target spells with flash you cast. When that spell or ability resolves, your spell won't be countered, but any additional effects of the countering spell or ability will still happen.
2020/04/17: If Cunning Nightbonder enters the battlefield while a spell with flash that you cast is on the stack, that spell can't be countered, even though you don't get the {1} discount.
2020/04/17: Players can't attempt to remove Cunning Nightbonder to raise the cost of a spell you wish to cast, but they can remove it to allow their spells and abilities to counter your spells.</Rulings>

When Lutri, the Spellchaser enters the battlefield, if you cast it, copy target instant or sorcery spell you control. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Lie Setiawan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479747</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2020/04/17: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2020/04/17: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy will have the same value of X.
2020/04/17: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Mythos of Vadrok), the division can't be changed, although the targets receiving that damage still can. The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2020/04/17: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2020/04/17: Your companion begins the game outside the game. In tournament play, this means your sideboard. In casual play, it's simply a card you own that's not in your starting deck.

<CardText>Companion — Each permanent card in your starting deck has an activated ability. (If this card is your chosen companion, you may put it into your hand from outside the game for {3} any time you could cast a sorcery.)
Abilities you activate that aren't mana abilities cost {2} less to activate. This effect can't reduce the mana in that cost to less than one mana.
{1}, {T}: Target creature can't block this turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479753</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities (such as cycling) and will have colons in their reminder text.
2020/04/17: An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate.
2020/04/17: Effects that reduce the generic mana cost of an activation cost can't reduce that cost's colored mana requirements. The activation cost is reduced by only {1} if doing so reduces that cost to one mana. For example, a cycling cost of {2} would become {1}, and one of {1}{R} would become {R}. The activation cost is unaffected if it already costs one or zero mana (such as the activation cost of Zirda's last ability).
2020/04/17: Activating Zirda's last ability after a creature has blocked won't remove the blocking creature from combat or cause the creature it blocked to become unblocked.
2020/04/17: Your companion begins the game outside the game. In tournament play, this means your sideboard. In casual play, it's simply a card you own that's not in your starting deck.
2020/04/17: Permanent cards are artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker cards. Land cards with basic land types have intrinsic activated mana abilities associated with those types.
2020/04/17: The requirements of the companion ability apply only to your starting deck. They do not apply to your sideboard.
2020/04/17: If more than one player wishes to reveal a companion, the starting player does so first, and players proceed in turn order. Once a player has chosen not to reveal a companion, that player can't change their mind.
2020/04/17: The companion's other abilities apply only if the creature is on the battlefield. They have no effect while the companion is outside the game.
2020/04/17: The companion ability has no effect if the card is in your starting deck and creates no restriction on putting a card with a companion ability into your starting deck. For example, Zirda may be in your starting deck even if your other permanent cards don't all have activated abilities.
2020/04/17: You may have one companion in the Commander variant. Your deck, including your commander, must meet its companion requirement. Your companion is not one of your one hundred cards.
2020/04/17: Before shuffling your deck to become your library, you may reveal one card from outside the game to be your companion if your starting deck meets the requirements of the companion ability. You can't reveal more than one. It remains revealed outside the game as the game begins.
2020/06/01: Wizards of the Coast has issued functional errata for the Companion mechanic. Instead of casting companions from outside the game: Once per game, any time you could cast a sorcery (during your main phase when the stack is empty), you can pay {3} to put your companion from your sideboard into your hand. This is a special action, not an activated ability. It happens immediately and can't be responded to. It can't be countered or stopped by cards like Phyrexian Revoker.

2020/04/17: If Crystalline Giant has one of the listed keywords but not because of a counter of that kind, that kind of counter is still eligible to be chosen at random.</Rulings>

<Name>The Ozolith</Name>
<Type>Legendary Artifact</Type>
<ManaCost>{1}</ManaCost>
<CardText>Whenever a creature you control leaves the battlefield, if it had counters on it, put those counters on The Ozolith.
At the beginning of combat on your turn, if The Ozolith has counters on it, you may move all counters from The Ozolith onto target creature.</CardText>
<Flavor>As it twists, so does all life around it.</Flavor>
<Artist>Sam Burley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479757</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: The Ozolith's first ability doesn't move counters off the creature that's left the battlefield. Instead, it causes you to put a number of counters of each kind of counter that was on that creature onto The Ozolith. Notably, if you somehow control a second The Ozolith, each one will receive the same number and kinds of counters that were on the creature that left the battlefield. Similarly, if the creature has an ability that triggers when it leaves the battlefield that refers to the number of counters it had, that ability will use the number of counters that were on the permanent, even if The Ozolith's first ability resolves first.
2020/04/17: +1/+1 counters on The Ozolith have no effect unless it becomes a creature. Keyword counters on The Ozolith will grant it keywords that may have no practical effect. For example, flying on a noncreature artifact is just strange, but hexproof on a noncreature artifact is entirely useful.
2020/04/17: As The Ozolith's last ability resolves, you choose whether to move the counters.
2020/04/17: You can't move only some of the counters from The Ozolith onto the target creature.
2020/04/17: If the target creature is an illegal target by the time The Ozolith's last ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve. You won't remove any counters from The Ozolith.
2020/04/17: If The Ozolith leaves the battlefield after the last ability triggers but before it resolves, you can't move any counters from it onto the target creature.</Rulings>

<CardText>Trample
Lethal damage dealt to creatures you control is determined by their power rather than their toughness.</CardText>
<Artist>Antonio José Manzanedo</Artist>
<Multiverseid>482524</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/04/17: Zilortha is printed only with its alternate name in the title bar. Despite that, its name is still only Zilortha, Strength Incarnate.
2020/04/17: Any time the game is checking whether damage is lethal or if a creature should be destroyed for having lethal damage marked on it, use the power of your creatures rather than their toughness to check the damage against. This includes being assigned trample damage, damage from Flame Spill, and so on.
2020/04/17: A creature with 0 power isn't destroyed unless it has at least 1 damage marked on it.
2020/04/17: A creature with 0 toughness is put into its owner's graveyard. This state-based action isn't a consequence of damage, so Zilortha doesn't affect it.
2020/04/17: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a creature you control may become lethal if Zilortha enters or leaves the battlefield during that turn.</Rulings>
