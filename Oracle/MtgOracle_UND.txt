2020/02/29: You may add in nicknames for the creatures you announce, but you must also get the creature's actual name in there to count. For example, "Gary, the Gray Merchant of Asphodel" is fine, but simply "Gary" wouldn't work.

<Artist>Mark Behm</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479486</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/01/19: Augment can't target creatures that aren't host creatures.
2018/01/19: Creatures with augment don't have a mana cost and can't be cast.
2018/01/19: Augment is an activated ability that you activate from your hand. To do so, reveal the card, choose a target host creature, and pay the augment cost. As this ability resolves, if the card with augment is still in your hand, put it onto the battlefield combined with the host creature.
2018/01/19: Augment can (and usually does) change the name, card types, subtypes, rules text, and power/toughness. The combined creature will have (at least) two artists and may now have multiple colors. Anything covered up in the augment process doesn't count, so ignore things to the left of the "metal bar" in the art of host creatures.
2018/01/19: The creature card with augment isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. This means if the host is destroyed, the creature with augment stays in your hand. You can't choose a different host, but you can activate augment again if there's another host available.
2018/01/19: You can't activate augment unless there is a host creature on the battlefield. It doesn't need to be yours. Note though that if you augment another player's host creature, they control the combined creature.
2018/01/19: You can't put more than one augment card on a single host creature. Once a host creature is augmented, the host part gets covered up and it's no longer a host creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/02/29: The DCI, originally short for Duelists' Convocation International and later short for absolutely nothing, was the name given to the governing body overseeing all Magic organized play. Although this name has since been retired, the card Look at Me, I'm the DCI persists in its honor.
2020/02/29: After you choose a card, all cards with that name are removed from the game in progress, no matter what zone they're in. If there are any in a player's sideboard, those are removed as well. Those cards remain out of the game for the rest of that game and for any subsequent game in that match.
2020/02/29: If cards from a player's main deck are banned, they must replace them with cards from their sideboard to begin the next game of the match. If enough cards are banned such that they can't meet the deck minimum, they can begin the game with their main deck having fewer cards than is normally required. However, if they end up with fewer than seven cards available, they'll lose the game as it begins when they are forced to try and draw from their suddenly empty library.
2020/02/29: The ban doesn't affect tokens, including ones that already exist when the ban goes into effect and future ones that may be created.</Rulings>

2020/02/29: B.O.B. is not a creature and is not itself a Beeble.
2020/02/29: Every time B.O.B loses loyalty, you choose which Beebles to sacrifice. If B.O.B. is dealt more damage than the number of Beebles you control, you sacrifice all of them, and then B.O.B. is put into its owner's graveyard.
2020/02/29: Sacrificing Beebles to account for B.O.B.'s lost loyalty happens before state-based actions clean up the lethally-damaged Beebles. The one that blocked can heroically be the one you sacrifice. Farewell, brave Beeble. B.O.B.-speed.
2020/02/29: If you control Doubling Season or a similar card that applies "is an effect would create one or more tokens," you'd create eight Beebles as B.O.B. enters the battlefield. However, because such cards apply only to effects and not costs, you'd still create only one Beeble if you activated B.O.B.'s first loyalty ability.
2020/02/29: Conversely, other cards like Primal Vigor don't mention "effects." If you control one of these cards, activating B.O.B.'s first loyalty ability would cause you to create two Beebles, and thus put two loyalty counters on B.O.B.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/02/29: Richard Garfield, Ph.D. essentially makes you play a variant of the Magic game called "Mental Magic." Here's how the game works. Whenever you cast a spell, you reveal the card to all players and choose any other card (see below for the cards that you can use) that has that card's mana cost. (Note that color very much does matter.) That spell can then be cast as though it was the chosen card. You aren't allowed to choose the same card twice.
2020/02/29: By default, you are limited to cards legal in the format you're playing. If you're playing Draft or Sealed Deck, you can name any card available in the format you're playing. If you're playing with Unsanctioned decks, anything goes. Discuss with your playgroup if you'd prefer to modify or eliminate these limitations.
2020/02/29: Playing cards as though they were other cards is optional.
2020/02/29: Each Richard tracks its own list of played cards. If one leaves the battlefield and another enters, cards previously played under the first Richard are available once again.
2020/02/29: If more than one player controls a Richard Garfield, Ph.D., the cards one player plays has no effect on the other players. For example, each player could play Savannah Lions as a Swords to Plowshares this way.
2020/02/29: The same is true if Richard Garfield, Ph.D. changes controllers. If you play a Savannah Lions as Swords to Plowshares, then an opponent gains control of Richard Garfield, Ph.D., that player can then do the same.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/02/29: Infinity Elemental's power is incalculable. Infinity Elemental has the greatest power among creatures on the battlefield (and off the battlefield for that matter), although it will tie with other Infinity Elementals. Gaining or losing power is meaningless to it, although effects that set its power to another number will still work.
2020/02/29: If you give Infinity Elemental lifelink and it deals damage, you will gain infinite life. You might think infinite life sounds like a lot, and you'd be right. Once at infinite life, your life total mostly can't change (see below). At infinite life and gain 2 life? You're at infinite life. At infinite life and lose 29 life? You're at infinite life. You can pay any amount of life and still be at infinite life. In fact, if you're at infinite life and get with an opposing Infinity Elemental, you'd still be at infinite life.
2020/02/29: If an effect sets your life total to a specific number, it will be that number, even if you previously had infinite life.
2020/02/29: If you're at infinite life and attempt to draw a card from an empty library . . . you lose. You're not immortal.
2020/02/29: Through various other cards, you can convert the infinite power of Infinity Elemental into other resources. For example, you could have infinite mana or create infinite tokens. You could draw infinite cards, but that many card don't exist, so it's probably not a great idea. Forcing another player to draw infinite cards, on the other hand . . . .</Rulings>

<Flavor>"Comin' through!"</Flavor>
<Artist>Even Amundsen</Artist>
<Watermark>League of Dastardly Doom</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>479450</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/02/29: Trample on an instant or sorcery is similar to how it works on an attacking creature. If Super-Duper Death Ray would deal more damage that what it would take to destroy the creature (called "excess damage"), it deals the excess to the creature's controller. For example, if you aim Super-Duper Death Ray at a 1/1 creature, it will deal 1 damage to the creature and 3 damage to its controller.
2020/02/29: If damage is already marked on the creature, that damage is considered when calculating excess damage. For example, say your opponent controls a 6/6 creature. Your first Super-Duper Death Ray deals 4 damage to it. Then your SECOND Super-Duper Death Ray (i.e. the one they never see coming) deals 2 damage to the creature and 2 damage to your opponent.
2020/02/29: Super-Duper Death Ray targets only the creature. It can deal damage to a player with hexproof, for example.
2020/02/29: If Super-Duper Death Ray doesn't resolve because its target leaves the battlefield or otherwise becomes an illegal target in response, it will have no effect. It won't deal damage to any creature or player.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/02/29: If the top card of your library is a creature, planeswalker, land, enchantment, or artifact card, it's also on the battlefield. Ta-da! This is, as they say, very weird.
2020/02/29: If the top card of your library is a creature card, it can attack. It does have haste, after all. It can also block.
2020/02/29: If the top card of your library is a permanent card with an activated ability that requires it to be tapped, that ability can be activated. Land cards on top of your library can be tapped for mana, and so on.
2020/02/29: A permanent card that becomes the top card of your library enters the battlefield (unless it went from the battlefield to the top of your library), so any enters-the-battlefield abilities will trigger and "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" abilities will apply. Similarly, a permanent card that stops being the top card of your library leaves the battlefield (unless it went from the top of your library to the battlefield directly).
2020/02/29: If the top card of your library is a creature card and it's put into your graveyard, the creature did die. Note that it wasn't destroyed or sacrificed or anything. It just died. <sad trombone noises>
2020/02/29: If a creature you control that isn't part of your library is put on top of your library, surprisingly little happens, at least at first. That creature doesn't leave or enter the battlefield. It just stays on the battlefield. Of course, now that it's also the top card of your library, you'll probably draw it soon. This is also true if something puts the top card of your library directly onto the battlefield, without you having to play it.
2020/02/29: If the top card is your library is an Aura card, that Aura is on the battlefield not attached to anything. As such, it's put into your graveyard. The new top card of your library is then revealed.
2020/02/29: If you are instructed to draw multiple cards, you draw them one at a time. Each card you draw after the first becomes the top card of your library briefly and is revealed. Each permanent card revealed this way enters and then leaves the battlefield, for any abilities that care about that.</Rulings>

<Artist>Andrea Radeck</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479494</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/01/19: Creatures with augment don't have a mana cost and can't be cast.
2018/01/19: Augment is an activated ability that you activate from your hand. To do so, reveal the card, choose a target host creature, and pay the augment cost. As this ability resolves, if the card with augment is still in your hand, put it onto the battlefield combined with the host creature.
2018/01/19: Augment can (and usually does) change the name, card types, subtypes, rules text, and power/toughness. The combined creature will have (at least) two artists and may now have multiple colors. Anything covered up in the augment process doesn't count, so ignore things to the left of the "metal bar" in the art of host creatures.
2018/01/19: Augment can't target creatures that aren't host creatures.
2018/01/19: The creature card with augment isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. This means if the host is destroyed, the creature with augment stays in your hand. You can't choose a different host, but you can activate augment again if there's another host available.
2018/01/19: You can't activate augment unless there is a host creature on the battlefield. It doesn't need to be yours. Note though that if you augment another player's host creature, they control the combined creature.
2018/01/19: You can't put more than one augment card on a single host creature. Once a host creature is augmented, the host part gets covered up and it's no longer a host creature.</Rulings>

2020/02/29: Slaying Mantis must be thrown onto the battlefield from at least three feet away. That is, three feet is a horizonal distance, not a vertical one.
2020/02/29: No player may interfere with the throwing of Slaying Mantis, including while it's in flight.
2020/02/29: If Slaying Mantis lands on multiple creatures, it fights each of them one-on-one. For example, Slaying Mantis lands on a 3/3, a 4/4, and a 5/5. Slaying Mantis deals 6 damage to each of them, destroying them all. At the same time, they deal a total of 12 damage to Slaying Mantis, destroying it. What a maneuver!
2020/02/29: Slaying Mantis will fight any creature an opponent controls that it touched as it entered, even if it didn't end up touching that creature when it stopped moving.
2020/02/29: If Slaying Mantis touches the object used to represent a creature token an opponent controls, it will fight that creature.
2020/02/29: If you create a token that's a copy of Slaying Mantis, it also enters via flying elbow. However, you must use a Magic card-sized object to represent the token. As Slaying Mantis's just a second ability won't apply, players can move around their permanents at any time, including while Slaying Mantis is in flight. So that's fun.</Rulings>

{0}: Return Entirely Normal Armchair to its owner's hand. Only your opponents may activate this ability and only if they see Entirely Normal Armchair.

<Artist>Tom Babbey</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479465</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/02/29: You must legally get Entirely Normal Armchair into your hand before you can attempt to sneak it onto the battlefield. For example, you can't sneak it in from your sideboard or collection during a game.
2020/02/29: Entirely Normal Armchair can be hidden in plain sight (i.e. just sitting there).
2020/02/29: Your opponent may activate Entirely Normal Armchair's first activated ability even if they can't literally see it, provided they can identify where it is. That is, you can't just put your hand over it and claim that can't see. Well, you can claim that, and it might be true, but it won't do what you want it to.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>479467</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/02/29: Krark's Other Thumb works with any die you're instructed or allowed to roll.
2020/02/29: The ignored roll never happened as far as any other effect is concerned. For example, an ability that triggers "whenever you roll a die" won't trigger for the ignored roll.
2020/02/29: If you are instructed to roll multiple dice, roll two for each one and choose which one counts.
2020/02/29: If the die roll includes a physical component, such as Ol' Buzzbark caring where the dice land, roll two dice for each one you would roll. You may need to use colored dice to keep each pair of dice clear so you can ignore one roll from each pair.
2020/02/29: Krark's Other Thumb applies to rerolls as well.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/02/29: Pointy Finger of Doom must rotate at least 360 degrees to count. There is no penalty for failing to spin it properly other than you must try again.
2020/02/29: Pointy Finger of Doom won't destroy itself, even though it is very close to itself.
2020/02/29: Once the Finger starts spinning, no permanents can be moved until after the ability completely resolves.
2020/02/29: If you create a token that's a copy of Pointy Finger of Doom, spin whatever object you're using to represent the token. Do not use living beings to represent the token.</Rulings>

<CardText>As Water Gun Balloon Game enters the battlefield, each player puts a pop! counter on "0."
Whenever a player casts a spell, move that player's pop! counter up one.
Whenever a player's pop! counter hits "5," that player creates a 5/5 pink Giant Teddy Bear creature token and resets all pop! counters to "0."</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Brill</Artist>
<Multiverseid>479473</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/02/29: In a game with more than two players, players can use paper and pencil to track where their pop! counter is. That is, the tracker located in Water Gun Balloon Game's art is fun, but not required to work.
2020/02/29: Pink joins gold and every eye color imaginable in the set of colors in silver-bordered Magic games.
2020/02/29: The pop! counters are considered to be on the inherent tracker in Water Gun Balloon Game's art, not on the permanent itself. Those counters can't be removed or moved to another permanent. Similarly, if you proliferate, you can't add more pop! counters to Water Gun Balloon Game.</Rulings>
