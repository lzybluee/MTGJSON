<Artist>Mark Zug</Artist>
<Multiverseid>110504</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.
2021/03/19: After a spell with split second resolves (or otherwise leaves the stack), players may again cast spells and activate abilities before the next object on the stack resolves.
2021/03/19: Angel's Grace doesn't prevent damage. It only changes the result of damage dealt to you. For example, a 5/5 creature with lifelink that deals damage to you will still cause its controller to gain 5 life, even if that damage reduces your life total from 3 to 1.
2021/03/19: Angel's Grace doesn't stop loss of life from effects that say that you lose life.
2021/03/19: If you have less than 1 life, damage dealt to you reduces your life total further below 0 (as normal).
2021/03/19: You can't pay more life than you have, even if you won't lose the game.
2021/03/19: In a Commander game, combat damage you're dealt by a commander is still tracked, even if it doesn't change your life total.
2021/03/19: Players still get priority while a card with split second is on the stack; their options are just limited to mana abilities and certain special actions.
2021/03/19: Players may turn face-down creatures face up while a spell with split second is on the stack.
2021/03/19: Split second doesn't stop triggered abilities from triggering, such as that of Chalice of the Void. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
2021/03/19: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jeremy Jarvis</Artist>
<Multiverseid>108814</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.

Suspend 5—{W} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {W} and exile it with five time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)</CardText>
<Artist>Jeff Miracola</Artist>
<Multiverseid>109741</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2021/03/19: As Restore Balance resolves, first the player whose turn it is chooses the appropriate number of lands they control, then each other player in turn order does the same knowing the choices made before them. Then all the lands that weren't chosen are sacrificed at the same time. Then, starting with the player whose turn it is again, each player chooses the appropriate number of creatures they control, then sacrifice their other creatures after all choices have been made.

2021/06/18: A card with no mana cost can't be cast normally; you'll need a way to cast it for an alternative cost or without paying its mana cost, such as by suspending it.
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.

<Artist>Mark Poole</Artist>
<Multiverseid>113505</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2021/06/18: If a card with no mana cost is given an alternative cost equal to its mana cost (by Snapcaster Mage, for example), that cost cannot be paid and the card cannot be cast this way.
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A card with no mana cost can't be cast normally; you'll need a way to cast it for an alternative cost or without paying its mana cost, such as by suspending it.</Rulings>

2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)</Rulings>

2021/03/19: Draining Whelk's ability counters the target spell even if you can't put counters on Draining Whelk, most likely because Draining Whelk left the battlefield before the ability resolved.

<Artist>Luca Zontini</Artist>
<Multiverseid>108909</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.

<Rulings>2006/09/25: If Ixidron and another creature are entering the battlefield at the same time, the other creature enters the battlefield face up.
2006/09/25: The controller of a face-down creature can look at it at any time, even if it doesn't have morph. Other players can't, but the rules for face-down permanents state that "you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other." As a result, all players must be able to figure out what each of the creatures Ixidron turned face down is.
2006/09/25: You turn the creatures face-down *as* Ixidron enters the battlefield. There is never a moment when Ixidron is on the battlefield and the creatures are face-up. If a creature on the battlefield has a "whenever another creature enters the battlefield" ability, it won't trigger because that creature will be face down before Ixidron enters the battlefield.
2006/09/25: Turning a face-down creature face-down typically has no effect; the creature's status is unchanged.
2018/04/27: Creatures turned face down by Ixidron are 2/2 creatures with no text, no name, no subtypes, no expansion symbol, and no mana cost. These values are copiable if an object becomes a copy of one of those creatures, and their normal values are not copiable.</Rulings>

2021/03/19: If a spell on the stack has split second while you control Teferi, you can't suspend creature cards since split second stops you from casting them, even though suspending them is a special action.
2021/03/19: Teferi's last ability means that in order for an opponent to cast a spell, it must be that opponent's turn, during a main phase, and the stack must be empty. This is true even if a rule or effect allows a sorcery to be cast at another time.
2021/03/19: If a spell or ability lets an opponent cast a spell as part of its effect (such as suspend and rebound do), that opponent can't cast that spell since the resolving ability is still on the stack. This is true even if the spell is an instant.
2021/03/19: If an effect allows an opponent to cast spells any time they could cast an instant (for example, if your opponent also controls Teferi), the restriction of Teferi's last ability takes precedence over that permission.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/03/19: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.

<Artist>John Zeleznik</Artist>
<Multiverseid>110499</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/09/25: If Trickbind counters an activated ability of a permanent, no activated abilities of that permanent can be activated for the remainder of the turn. This includes activated abilities other than the one that was countered, as well as any mana abilities that permanent may have. Other abilities of that permanent, including triggered abilities and static abilities, are unaffected.
2006/09/25: Trickbind can't counter or prevent paying the morph cost to turn a face-down creature face up, since that action doesn't use the stack.
2006/09/25: Trickbind can be used to counter the flanking triggered ability.
2006/09/25: Trickbind can be used to counter the echo triggered ability. If so, the echo ability won't trigger again so the echo cost is never paid.
2006/09/25: Trickbind can be used to counter the suspend "remove a counter" ability. If so, the counter won't get removed, but the ability will trigger again as normal later on. Trickbind can also be used to counter the suspend "play this card" ability. If so, the card stays exiled (the ability won't trigger again). Using suspend to exile a card in your hand is neither an activated nor a triggered ability, so it can't be countered this way.
2006/09/25: Trickbind can be used to counter the madness triggered ability. The affected card will remain exiled.
2006/09/25: Trickbind can be used to counter the storm triggered ability. Doing so prevents the copies from being created, but doesn't counter the original storm spell.
2016/06/08: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text.
2021/03/19: Players still get priority while a card with split second is on the stack; their options are just limited to mana abilities and certain special actions.
2021/03/19: After a spell with split second resolves (or otherwise leaves the stack), players may again cast spells and activate abilities before the next object on the stack resolves.
2021/03/19: If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.
2021/03/19: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
2021/03/19: Split second doesn't stop triggered abilities from triggering, such as that of Chalice of the Void. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
2021/03/19: Players may turn face-down creatures face up while a spell with split second is on the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Quinton Hoover</Artist>
<Multiverseid>109765</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: If a copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2021/03/19: If a copied creature is copying something else, Vesuvan Shapeshifter uses the copiable values of that creature. In most cases, Vesuvan Shapeshifter will copy whatever that creature is copying.
2021/03/19: Vesuvan Shapeshifter copies exactly what is printed on the creature it's copying and nothing else (unless it's copying a creature that's copying something else or that's a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether a creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Most notably, if it copies a creature that's not normally a creature, it won't be a creature.
2021/03/19: If a copied creature is a token that isn't a copy of something else, Vesuvan Shapeshifter copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it. Vesuvan Shapeshifter isn't a token in this case.
2021/03/19: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger if Vesuvan Shapeshifter is entering the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work. If a Vesuvan Shapeshifter becomes a copy of a creature after it's already on the battlefield, these abilities won't apply as Vesuvan Shapeshifter becomes a copy since it's not entering the battlefield; instead, any "As [this creature] is turned face up" or "When [this creature] is turned face up" abilities will apply.
2021/03/19: If something copies Vesuvan Shapeshifter, the new copy will also have the triggered ability to turn it face down. However, once face-down, it won't have Vesuvan Shapeshifter's morph ability, so it can't be turned face up unless whatever it's copying also has a morph ability.</Rulings>

Suspend 4—{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {U} and exile it with four time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)</CardText>
<Artist>Heather Hudson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>113615</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: Players still get priority while a card with split second is on the stack; their options are just limited to mana abilities and certain special actions.
2021/03/19: Players may turn face-down creatures face up while a spell with split second is on the stack.
2021/03/19: Split second doesn't stop triggered abilities from triggering, such as that of Chalice of the Void. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
2021/03/19: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
2021/03/19: If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.
2021/03/19: After a spell with split second resolves (or otherwise leaves the stack), players may again cast spells and activate abilities before the next object on the stack resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Doug Chaffee</Artist>
<Multiverseid>108910</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>116721</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: Because targets are chosen for spells before costs (such as "Sacrifice three creatures") are paid, Dread Return cast with flashback can't target a creature card that will be sacrificed to pay its cost.
2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/03/19: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.
2021/03/19: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</Rulings>

Each player exiles all creature cards from their graveyard, then sacrifices all creatures they control, then puts all cards they exiled this way onto the battlefield.</CardText>
<Artist>Greg Staples</Artist>
<Multiverseid>113521</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2021/03/19: While Living End is resolving, first each player exiles their graveyard at the same time, then each player sacrifices all creatures they control at the same time, and finally each player puts their exiled cards onto the battlefield at the same time.
2021/03/19: "All cards they exiled this way" refers only to the cards exiled in the first part of the effect. If a replacement effect (such as that of Leyline of the Void) exiles any of the sacrificed creatures instead of putting them into the graveyard, those cards aren't returned to the battlefield.
2021/06/18: If a card with no mana cost is given an alternative cost equal to its mana cost (by Snapcaster Mage, for example), that cost cannot be paid and the card cannot be cast this way.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A card with no mana cost can't be cast normally; you'll need a way to cast it for an alternative cost or without paying its mana cost, such as by suspending it.
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/09/25: When the life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if player A has 5 life and player B has 3 life before the exchange, player A will lose 2 life and player B will gain 2 life. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.
2011/01/01: If an effect says that a player can't lose life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player who has a lower life total; in that case, the exchange won't happen.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Phthisis tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. No player loses life. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), its controller does lose life.
2021/03/19: If the creature's power is negative, you still add its power and toughness to determine how much life is lost. If that total is negative, its controller doesn't gain or lose any life. For example, Phthisis destroying a -1/3 creature would cause a loss of 2 life. Pthisis destroying a -4/3 creature would cause no loss of life.

<Rulings>2021/03/19: As Smallpox resolves, first each player loses 1 life at the same time. Next, each player chooses a card in hand without revealing it, then all of the cards are discarded at the same time. Then starting with the player whose turn it is and proceeding in turn order, each player chooses a creature, knowing the choices made before them. All of the creatures are sacrificed at the same time, then finally repeat this process for lands.
2021/03/19: Any abilities that trigger while Smallpox is resolving will wait to be put onto the stack until Smallpox is done resolving.
2021/03/19: Any abilities of the lands sacrificed may modify or trigger on the creatures being sacrificed and on the cards being discarded. Abilities of the creatures won't modify or trigger on the lands being sacrificed, but may modify or trigger on the cards being discarded.</Rulings>

<Artist>Rob Alexander</Artist>
<Multiverseid>111048</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: Reiterate can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2021/03/19: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will resolve before the original spell does.
2021/03/19: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).

2021/03/19: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed, although the targets receiving that damage still can. The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2021/03/19: You can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2021/06/18: If a card with no mana cost is given an alternative cost equal to its mana cost (by Snapcaster Mage, for example), that cost cannot be paid and the card cannot be cast this way.
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A card with no mana cost can't be cast normally; you'll need a way to cast it for an alternative cost or without paying its mana cost, such as by suspending it.</Rulings>

<CardText>Suspend 5—{G} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {G} and exile it with five time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Frazier</Artist>
<Multiverseid>108807</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.

2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.

2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/10/15: Anything that triggers during the resolution of this will wait to be put on the stack until everything is put onto the battlefield and resolution is complete. The player whose turn it is will put all of their triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order will do the same. (The last ability put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.)
2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.

2021/03/19: The permanents enter the battlefield sequentially. This means that ones put onto the battlefield earlier may affect how later ones enter and later ones may cause triggered abilities of earlier ones to trigger, but not vice versa.
2021/06/18: If a card with no mana cost is given an alternative cost equal to its mana cost (by Snapcaster Mage, for example), that cost cannot be paid and the card cannot be cast this way.

<Rulings>2013/07/01: Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative. However, for some abilities, like flying, having more than one instance of the ability doesn't provide any additional benefit.

2021/03/19: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a Sliver may become lethal if Might Sliver leaves the battlefield during that turn.</Rulings>

<CardText>When Nantuko Shaman enters the battlefield, if you control no tapped lands, draw a card.
Suspend 1—{2}{G}{G} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{G}{G} and exile it with a time counter on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)</CardText>
<Artist>Daren Bader</Artist>
<Multiverseid>109726</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: If you control any tapped lands immediately after Nantuko Shaman enters the battlefield, its ability doesn't trigger at all. If you control any tapped lands as the ability resolves, you don't draw a card. Your lands could become tapped and then untapped again in between, however.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/03/19: "Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."
2021/03/19: You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
2021/03/19: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/03/19: A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.
2021/03/19: You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.
2021/03/19: If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>114903</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: In a Commander game where this card is your commander, you cannot suspend it from the Command zone.
2021/03/19: Ith's ability can target an untapped attacking creature. It will still prevent any combat damage dealt to and dealt by that creature this turn.
2021/03/19: The creature isn't removed from combat; it just has its damage prevented. It's still an attacking creature until the combat phase is complete.
2021/03/19: You can activate Ith's ability targeting an attacking creature you control during the combat damage step or the end of combat step. It'll untap and the damage it had already dealt won't be undone.
2021/06/18: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it. (In some rare cases, another player may gain control of the creature spell itself. If this happens, the creature won't enter the battlefield with haste.)
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.</Rulings>

<CardText>Suspend 3—{0} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, pay {0} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)
{T}, Sacrifice Lotus Bloom: Add three mana of any one color.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Zug</Artist>
<Multiverseid>114904</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/06/18: Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that allows you to exile the card from your hand with the specified number of time counters (the number before the dash) on it by paying its suspend cost (listed after the dash). The second is a triggered ability that removes a time counter from the suspended card at the beginning of each of your upkeeps. The third is a triggered ability that causes you to cast the card when the last time counter is removed. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of that creature (or, in rare cases, you lose control of the creature spell while it's on the stack).
2021/06/18: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effects that modify when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that stop you from casting it (such as from Meddling Mage's ability) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/06/18: Cards exiled with suspend are exiled face up.
2021/06/18: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/06/18: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/06/18: If an effect refers to a "suspended card," that means a card that (1) has suspend, (2) is in exile, and (3) has one or more time counters on it.
2021/06/18: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again at the beginning of the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/06/18: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) triggers. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/06/18: If the second triggered ability is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. You must do so even if it requires targets and the only legal targets are ones that you really don't want to target. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/06/18: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/06/18: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," such as with suspend, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if you want to cast the card.
2021/06/18: You are never forced to activate mana abilities to pay costs, so if there is a mandatory additional mana cost (such as from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben), you can decline to activate mana abilities to pay for it and hence fail to cast the suspended card, leaving it in exile.
2021/06/18: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/06/18: The mana value of a spell cast without paying its mana cost is determined by its mana cost, even though that cost wasn't paid.
2021/06/18: A card with no mana cost can't be cast normally; you'll need a way to cast it for an alternative cost or without paying its mana cost, such as by suspending it.
2021/06/18: If a card with no mana cost is given an alternative cost equal to its mana cost (by Snapcaster Mage, for example), that cost cannot be paid and the card cannot be cast this way.</Rulings>

There's no opportunity to tap the extras for mana.
2021/03/19: A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have taken mulligans. If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand, the starting player takes all such actions first in any order, followed by each other player in turn order. Then the first turn begins.</Rulings>

<Artist>Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>113543</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/03/19: Vesuva copies exactly what is printed on the land it's copying and nothing else (unless it's copying a land that's copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether a land is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its types, and so on.
2021/03/19: If the copied land is copying something else, Vesuva uses the copiable values of that land. In most cases, Vesuva will be a copy of whatever that land is copying.
2021/03/19: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied land will trigger if Vesuva is entering the battlefield. Any "As [this land] enters the battlefield" or "[This land] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied land will also work.
2021/03/19: If Vesuva somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another land, Vesuva can't become a copy of that land. You may choose only a land that's already on the battlefield.
2021/03/19: If you don't choose a land on the battlefield, Vesuva enters the battlefield untapped as itself, and will not be able to tap for mana.</Rulings>
