You may look at the top card of your library any time.
You may cast Aura and Equipment spells from the top of your library. When you cast an Equipment spell this way, it gains "When this Equipment enters the battlefield, attach it to target creature you control."</CardText>

<Multiverseid>531830</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: You can look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction; see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
2021/07/23: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish doing so. This means that if you cast a spell from the top of your library, you can't look at the next card until you're done paying for that spell.
2021/07/23: Galea, Kindler of Hope doesn't change when you can cast Aura and Equipment spells. Normally, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty, although flash may change this.
2021/07/23: You'll still pay all costs for the spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs if any are available.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>531832</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: To venture into the dungeon, a player moves their venture marker into the next room of the dungeon they are currently in. If they aren't currently in a dungeon, that player instead chooses a dungeon card from outside the game, puts it into the command zone, and moves their venture marker onto the first room.
2021/07/23: Moving into a dungeon room will cause its room ability to trigger.
2021/07/23: Once you resolve the last room ability of a dungeon, that dungeon is now completed and is removed from the game.
2021/07/23: A player may only have one dungeon in the command zone at a time.
2021/07/23: The player venturing into the dungeon chooses which dungeon they will venture into. They may choose a dungeon that they have already completed this game.
2021/07/23: Sefris of the Hidden Ways' first ability looks only at the type the card has in the graveyard, not the type it had in any other zone. For example, animated lands dying won't cause the ability to trigger. The opposite is also true. For example, if a creature that was cast as an Adventure is countered, it's a creature card in the graveyard and the first ability will trigger.
2021/07/23: You can only move forward (well, downward) in a dungeon, never backwards or sideways.
2021/07/23: Dungeons are removed from the game as a state-based action.
2021/07/23: If you somehow venture into the dungeon while a room's ability is on the stack, you will continue on in the dungeon. If you're already in the last room, complete that dungeon and start a new one.
2021/07/23: Choosing the dungeon or room to venture into is part of resolving the venture into the dungeon keyword action. Once that choice is made, players may not respond until after the appropriate room ability has triggered.
2021/07/23: Dungeon cards are not part of a player's deck or sideboard. In both constructed and limited formats, players can use any dungeon card when they venture into the dungeon.
2021/09/24: Sefris of the Hidden Ways must be on the battlefield for its first ability to trigger. It does not trigger when Sefris goes to the graveyard from the battlefield, even if other creature cards also went to the graveyard at the same time.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>531912</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: Some abilities still work even if they have been removed. Specifically, static abilities that change an object's types or change an object's colors will still apply even if those abilities are lost.
2021/07/23: If a creature has a characteristic-defining ability that sets its power and/or toughness loses that ability, the power and/or toughness (as appropriate) become 0.
2021/07/23: If you target an Aura with Immovable Rod's last ability, it will lose its enchant ability and be put into its owner's graveyard because it can't legally enchant anything. An Equipment that loses its abilities loses its equip ability, so you won't be able to move it that way, but it will stay attached to the creature it's equipping, if any.

2021/07/23: As the enters-the-battlefield ability is resolving, any targets that couldn't be legally attached to the creature enchanted by Mantle of the Ancients stay in your graveyard.
2021/07/23: If Mantle of the Ancients becomes attached to a different creature in response to its enters-the-battlefield ability, the creature it's attached to as that ability is resolving is the "enchanted creature," even though you used the original enchanted creature to choose targets. This means some of those targets may become illegal.
2021/07/23: If Mantle of the Ancients leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the last permanent it was attached to before leaving the battlefield is the "enchanted creature" (even if that permanent is no longer a creature).</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>531916</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: Phased out permanents are treated as though they don't exist. They can't be the target of spells or abilities, their static abilities have no effect on the game, their triggered abilities can't trigger, they can't attack or block, and so on.
2021/07/23: Notably, this means you cannot equip Robe of Stars to another creature while it is phased out. If you activate the Astral Projection ability of an attached Robe of Stars in response to the equip ability, Robe of Stars will be phased out before the equip ability resolves and will not be moved.
2021/07/23: As a creature is phased out, Auras and Equipment attached to it (including Robe of Stars) also phase out at the same time. Those Auras and Equipment will phase in attached to the creature they were attached to when they phased out.
2021/07/23: Permanents phase back in during their controller's untap step, immediately before that player untaps their permanents. Creatures that phase in this way are able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn. If a permanent had counters on it when it phased out, it will have those counters when it phases back in.
2021/07/23: An attacking or blocking creature that phases out is removed from combat.
2021/07/23: Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
2021/07/23: Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration, such as that of Mind Flayer, ignore phased-out objects. If ignoring those objects causes the effect's conditions to no longer be met, the duration will expire.
2021/07/23: Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
2021/07/23: If an opponent gains control of one of your creatures, that creature phases out, and the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases back in, that creature phases in under your control as that opponent's next untap step begins. If they leave the game before their next untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after their turn would have begun.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.

2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ralph Horsley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>531922</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: If you roll a natural 4 while resolving the Focus Beam ability, you will scry before you draw a card for the Perfect Illumination ability.
2021/07/23: If you're instructed to roll multiple dice (with one exception, see below) and more than one shows the highest natural result, the Perfect Illumination ability will trigger that many times.
2021/07/23: Any die roll that is ignored, such as from Pixie Guide's effect, will not cause the Perfect Illumination ability to trigger.
2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards.

<CardText>Flash
When Phantom Steed enters the battlefield, exile another target creature you control until Phantom Steed leaves the battlefield.
Whenever Phantom Steed attacks, create a tapped and attacking token that's a copy of the exiled card, except it's an Illusion in addition to its other types. Sacrifice that token at end of combat.</CardText>
<Artist>Brian Valeza</Artist>
<Multiverseid>531923</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: Phantom Steed has received a nonfunctional update to its wording. The printed card refers to the "exiled creature." The corrected text ("exiled card") is included above.
2021/07/23: If Phantom Steed leaves the battlefield before its ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2021/07/23: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist. When the card returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the card that was exiled.
2021/07/23: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield. Phantom Steed's last ability won't create any tokens.
2021/07/23: Although the token created by the triggered ability is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for the purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2021/07/23: You declare which player or planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or planeswalker Phantom Steed is attacking.
2021/07/23: If the exiled card has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2021/07/23: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2021/07/23: If Phantom Steed somehow exiles a noncreature card, such as an animated land, it will still create a copy of that card when it attacks. It enters the battlefield tapped and will be sacrificed at the end of combat. However, it is not attacking and it is not an Illusion.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: If multiple Rods of Absorption are on the battlefield at the same time, any player casting an instant or sorcery spell will cause all of them to trigger. As the spell resolves, its controller will choose which of the Rods gets to exile it.
2021/07/23: Each Rod of Absorption tracks the cards it has exiled separately. If Rod of Absorption is destroyed and then later brought back to the battlefield, it will not be able to access any of the cards that it had exiled before.
2021/07/23: If a spell is countered or it never resolves, Rod of Absorption will not exile it.
2021/07/23: When Rod of Absorption's last ability resolves, you cast as many spells with total mana value X or less from among the exiled cards as you would like in any order you choose. Cards not cast this way will remain in exile indefinitely.
2021/07/23: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the spell.
2021/07/23: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: All creatures are chosen and sacrificed before the die is rolled. You don't get to see what the result of the die roll is before choosing which creature to sacrifice.
2021/07/23: You add only the toughness of the creature you sacrificed this way, not the toughness of any creatures your opponent sacrificed. If you didn't sacrifice a creature this way, you will still roll a d20, but you will not add anything to the roll.
2021/07/23: If a player sacrifices their commander this way, they won't be able to choose whether to put it into the command zone until after Danse Macabre has finished resolving. Notably, this means that the sacrificed commander is a legal choice for the spell's controller to return to the battlefield.

<Rulings>2021/07/23: When the triggered ability that Hellish Rebuke grants permanents resolves, if that permanent's controller can't sacrifice it, they will still lose 2 life. Similarly, if they can't lose life, they will still sacrifice the permanent.
2021/07/23: If a player casts more than one Hellish Rebuke in a turn, permanents will gain multiple instances of the triggered ability. Each will trigger and resolve separately. For instance, if you cast Hellish Rebuke twice, each permanent which damaged you will cause its controller to lose 4 life.
2021/07/23: If more than one player casts Hellish Rebuke in a turn, some permanents will gain multiple instances of the triggered ability that refer to different players. Each will trigger only for the player who cast the Hellish Rebuke that granted it the ability.
2021/07/23: Copies of Hellish Rebuke that weren't cast will give opponents permanents the ability, but that ability won't do anything because no player cast that copy of Hellish Rebuke.
2021/07/23: If a spell or ability causes another player to gain control of Hellish Rebuke while it is on the stack, permanents controlled by the opponents of that player will gain the ability (probably including permanents you control). However, you're still the player that cast Hellish Rebuke, so the ability will trigger whenever one of those permanents deals damage to you, not the player who controlled Hellish Rebuke as it resolved.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger.

2021/07/23: Playing a card this way follows all the normal timing rules for that card. For example, if you play a land this way, you may do so only during your main phase while the stack is empty and only if you havem't yet played a land (unless another effect allows you to play additional lands).
2021/07/23: If you control an opponent's Share the Spoils and that player loses the game, Share the Spoils leaves the game with them and the first ability won't trigger.

<Artist>Aaron J. Riley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>531941</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: The first spell you cast from exile each turn will have cascade, even if it's not the first spell you've cast that turn.
2021/07/23: However, if you cast a spell from exile and then later that turn Wild-Magic Sorcerer comes under your control, Wild-Mage Sorcerer won't give cascade to any other spell you cast from exile that turn.
2021/07/23: If you control more than one Wild-Magic Sorcerer, the first spell you cast from exile will have that many instances of cascade, each of which will trigger separately.
2021/07/23: If, while resolving the cascade ability from the first spell you cast from exile in a turn, you cascade into a second Wild-Magic Sorcerer, the spell will not cascade again.
2021/07/23: A spell's mana value is determined only by its mana cost. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions. For example, Wild-Magic Sorcerer's mana value is always 4.
2021/07/23: Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2021/07/23: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2021/07/23: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
2021/07/23: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2021/07/23: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the card.
2021/07/23: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2021/07/23: Due to a recent rules change to cascade, not only do you stop exiling cards if you exile a nonland card with lesser mana value than the spell with cascade, but the resulting spell you cast must also have lesser mana value. Previously, in cases where a card's mana value differed from the resulting spell, such as with some modal double-faced cards or cards with an Adventure, you could cast a spell with a higher mana value than the exiled card.
2021/07/23: The mana value of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If cascade allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half but not both halves.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Unblocked creatures with double strike deal damage twice, which will cause Midnight Pathlighter's last ability to trigger twice.
2021/07/23: To venture into the dungeon, a player moves their venture marker into the next room of the dungeon they are currently in. If they aren't currently in a dungeon, that player instead chooses a dungeon card from outside the game, puts it into the command zone, and moves their venture marker onto the first room.
2021/07/23: Moving into a dungeon room will cause its room ability to trigger.

2021/07/23: The player venturing into the dungeon chooses which dungeon they will venture into. They may choose a dungeon that they have already completed this game.
2021/07/23: Dungeon cards are not part of a player's deck or sideboard. In both constructed and limited formats, players can use any dungeon card when they venture into the dungeon.
2021/07/23: You can only move forward (well, downward) in a dungeon, never backwards or sideways.
2021/07/23: Dungeons are removed from the game as a state-based action.

2021/07/23: Choosing the dungeon or room to venture into is part of resolving the venture into the dungeon keyword action. Once that choice is made, players may not respond until after the appropriate room ability has triggered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: As Nihiloor's first triggered ability resolves, you choose up to one creature for each opponent, and tap them all at the same time. Then, a separate triggered ability is put on the stack for each creature you tapped this way. Those abilities are placed on the stack in the order you choose. If tapping those creature caused any other abilities you control to trigger, those are also placed on the stack at this time.
2021/07/23: Both the tapped creature's power and the target creature's power are checked both as you put the ability on the stack and as the ability resolves in order to make sure the target is legal.
2021/07/23: If the tapped creature is no longer on the battlefield as the trigger resolves, use its last existence on the battlefield to determine whether the target is still legal as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: If a creature you tapped for Nihiloor's ability is somehow no longer tapped as the reflexive triggered ability resolves, that ability will still resolve and you will still gain control of the target as long as it has less power than the creature you tapped.
2021/07/23: If Nihiloor leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves or before its reflexive triggered abilities resolve, then you won't gain control of any creatures.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.

2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger.

Good luck!
2021/07/23: Monstrous isn't an ability that a creature has. It's just something true about that creature. If the creature stops being a creature or loses its abilities, it will continue to be monstrous.
2021/07/23: An ability that triggers when a creature becomes monstrous won't trigger if that creature isn't on the battlefield when its monstrosity ability resolves.

2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever equipped creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on it.
Whenever equipped creature deals combat damage, roll a d12. If the result is greater than the damage dealt or the result is 12, double the number of +1/+1 counters on that creature.

<Rulings>2021/07/23: To double the number of +1/+1 counters on a permanent, count the number of +1/+1 counters that are currently on that permanent and put that many more on it. Any replacement effects that change this number will apply accordingly.
2021/07/23: If the equipped creature takes lethal damage at the same time that it deals combat damage, it will die before the counters on it can be doubled. However, you will still roll a d12, which may cause abilities of other permanents to trigger.
2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
