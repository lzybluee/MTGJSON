<Rulings>2019/11/12: Vanguard cards can be used only in a format that allows them (such as Limited events using the Mystery Booster set). Each player may begin the game with up to one vanguard card they own in the command zone. This card doesn't count towards the minimum deck size.
2019/11/12: Vanguard cards can't be included in a deck or brought into the game from outside the game.
2019/11/12: Your starting and maximum hand size is modified by the vanguard as noted. Your starting life total is similarly modified.
2019/11/12: A vanguard with a requirement can't be your vanguard unless its requirement is met as the game begins.
2019/11/12: Your starting deck includes only those cards that will be shuffled to become your library. It doesn't include your sideboard or any other cards that begin the game outside the game.

<CardText>All Slivers have banding. (Any creatures with banding, and up to one without, can attack in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If any creatures with banding you control are blocking or being blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked by or is blocking.)</CardText>
<Artist>Alicia Mickes</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476132</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: Creatures don't "share" abilities in a band. For example, if Banding Sliver bands with a creature with flying, Banding Sliver can be blocked by a creature without flying, and this causes the blocking creature to also block the creature with flying.
2019/11/12: While blocking, a creature with banding can block along with any number of creatures. This isn't a "band," but it's similar for how damage assignment is modified.
2019/11/12: A player who controls a creature blocked by or blocking multiple creatures must choose a combat damage assignment order for those creatures. If each creature in that order loses banding, the order will be enforced. Otherwise, the player who controls the creature with banding can assign the other creature's damage ignoring the damage assignment order and without assigning lethal damage to a creature before assigning damage to another creature.</Rulings>

2019/11/12: Any player's Flagbearer may be targeted. For example, if each player controls a Coalition Honor Guard and you control Enroll in the Coalition, an opponent's Shock could target either creature or you, but not another player.
2019/11/12: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (written with "when," "whenever," or "at") don't have to target a Flagbearer.
2019/11/12: If a spell or ability's targets are changed, or if a copy of a spell or ability is put onto the stack and has new targets chosen, it doesn't have to target a Flagbearer.
2019/11/12: If a player chooses targets for another player's spell or ability, or if targets are chosen randomly, they don't have to target a Flagbearer.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: You can find more information on the latest Mythic Championship, including decklists, at MTGEsports.com.
2019/11/12: The "winning deck" is the deck that was played by the winner of the finals. That is, if the event uses multiple formats (such as a Constructed format and a Booster Draft), whatever format was played in the finals determines what the "winning deck" is.
2019/11/12: Normally there is only one winning deck for each Mythic Championship. If that event was a team event, there may be more than one.
2019/11/12: If a Mythic Championship is in progress during your game, Metagamer's effect affects spells that share a name with the winning deck in the previous Mythic Championship. If the Mythic Championship concludes while your game is in progress, the spells affected by Metagamer's effect will immediately change.
2019/11/12: Metagamer's effect affects spells that share a name with cards in the winning deck, not just the physical cards played in that deck.
2019/11/12: The last Mythic Championship will be (or was) Mythic Championship VI in November 2019. After that event, Metagamer will receive errata so that it refers to the winning deck from the latest Players Tour, Players Tour Final, or Mythic Invitational. If a new tournament series comparable to those is announced in the future, the rules text will be updated again. This errata won't be reflected in the displayed card text.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>476142</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: If you choose more than one mode, creatures are destroyed in the order specified. This may cause some creatures to escape destruction. For example, if you choose to destroy small and medium creatures while you control a 2/2 creature with the ability "Other creatures you control get +1/+1" and another 2/2 creature that's a 3/3 creature thanks to that ability, the first creature is destroyed, then the second creature won't be destroyed when medium creatures are destroyed since it's become a 2/2 creature.
2019/11/12: If a creature has negative power or toughness, consider the actual value when determining the size of the creature. For example, a 0/7 creature that's been given -2/-1 is a -2/6 creature, which totals 4, making it small.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: Normally, each player assigns a creature's combat damage and it's immediately dealt. While Stack of Paperwork is on the battlefield, this assignment is put onto the stack as a single game object controlled by no player, and all damage is dealt as assigned as that object resolves.
2019/11/12: If a creature leaves the battlefield, combat damage it deals is dealt by that creature as it last existed on the battlefield. Combat damage that would be dealt to it isn't dealt.
2019/11/12: If a creature that would be dealt combat damage stops being a creature, combat damage that would be dealt to it isn't dealt. If a creature that would deal combat damage stops being a creature, it deals combat damage.
2019/11/12: If Stack of Paperwork leaves the battlefield once a combat damage object is on the stack, combat damage still uses the stack for this combat damage step.
2019/11/12: No other aspects of the previous combat damage rules are applied while Stack of Paperwork is on the battlefield. Blocking creatures are still ordered and combat damage must be assigned going through that order, requiring lethal damage to be assigned in that order.</Rulings>

If a commander has dealt 21 combat damage to a player while it's a commander, that player loses the game. Damage dealt before it was your commander isn't counted.
2019/11/12: If a card becomes your commander during a game, no deckbuilding rules of the Commander variant apply. You can still play cards that don't correspond to that commander's color identity.

<CardText>Four-faced (Whenever this becomes tapped, move it to the next stage, or to stage 1 if it's at stage 4.)
Stage 1 — (1/4)

Stage 3 — (2/4) {U}: Loopy Lobster gets +1/-1 until end of turn.
Stage 4 — (4/4) Vigilance. {T}: Draw 2 cards.</CardText>
<Artist>Rachel Turian</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476156</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: A permanent with four-faced starts at stage 1.
2019/11/12: If Loopy Lobster somehow enters the battlefield tapped, it will still be at stage 1.
2019/11/12: If an object becomes a copy of a permanent with four-faced, that object remains at the stage it was. If it wasn't at a stage, it's at stage 1.
2019/11/12: A creature card with four-faced that isn't on the battlefield is a 0/0 creature.
2019/11/12: Activating Loopy Lobster's stage 3 ability creates an effect that lasts even if it moves to stage 4 during that turn.
2019/11/12: Evolve means "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature has greater power or toughness than this creature, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature."
2019/11/12: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2019/11/12: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.
2019/11/12: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2019/11/12: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2019/11/12: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2019/11/12: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, its toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: If a card with bank doesn't resolve for any reason (such as being countered, or all of its targets becoming illegal if it has any), it won't be banked.
2019/11/12: Banked cards begin the next games in a match in exile. They're not outside the game.
2019/11/12: Once you cast a banked card from exile, it behaves like any other spell. It may be countered, and it'll be put onto the battlefield if it resolves as a permanent spell, or into its owner's graveyard if it's not a permanent spell.
2019/11/12: If you cast a spell you don't own, or gain control of a spell, you didn't cast it from your hand, so you don't bank it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: If Squidnapper leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, you won't gain control of the target creature at all.
2019/11/12: Paying a ransom cost to end an effect is a special action. The card's owner may pay that cost any time they have priority, and players can't take actions in between the time the player announces their intent to pay and the time the card returns to the zone from which it came.
2019/11/12: If a card with a ransom ability loses that ability, it has no ransom cost. No player may pay its ransom cost.

<Artist>Ethan Fleischer</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476160</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: If the target permanent is a token, it stops at exile. It doesn't move to any of the other zones or return to the battlefield. It does not pass Go. It does not collect two hundred mana.
2019/11/12: Once the exiled permanent returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2019/11/12: No player may take actions while The Grand Tour is resolving, and any abilities that trigger while the permanent is on tour won't be put onto the stack until The Grand Tour has finished resolving.
2019/11/12: The Grand Tour does not include the command zone or zones belonging to any player other than its owner. Look for The MegaGrand Tour, coming soon.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have finished taking mulligans.
2019/11/12: Unlike a normal token, a token card doesn't cease to exist in a zone other than the battlefield. It's both a token and a card. It can move between zones any number of times and continues to exist for the rest of the game.
2019/11/12: If a token card is put into a hidden zone, you must use a supplementary token card with a Magic card back to represent it. Since these don't exist yet, you may need to be creative.
2019/11/12: For effects that look for or modify the creation of tokens, creating token cards isn't the same as creating tokens

2019/11/12: While playing with your hand revealed, you can still reveal cards to pay a cost.
2019/11/12: If you need to choose a card in your hand without revealing it to other players (most likely because an effect instructs each player to discard a card), you can hide your hand while choosing one or use any other method to keep your choice secret.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: Spellmorph is a variant of morph. A spellmorph ability is a morph ability, and a spellmorph cost is a morph cost. All rules and rulings for morph apply to spellmorph, except for how to turn it face up.
2019/11/12: To cast a spell with a morph ability, you turn it face down before determining whether it's legal to cast. The face-down spell (and the permanent it becomes) is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0, and the cost to cast the spell is {3}. Other effects that apply to the spell or permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2019/11/12: The controller of the face-down creature with spellmorph can cast it, regardless of who cast the face-down creature spell.
2019/11/12: To cast a spell with spellmorph from the battlefield, first reveal that it has a spellmorph cost. If it does, ignore all effects that are affecting it to determine whether it's legal to cast; it's no longer a creature. If it's legal to cast, move it to the stack. If you realize that you can't legally cast the spell, the game rewinds and it remains face down on the battlefield.
2019/11/12: If a face-down creature with spellmorph loses all abilities, it can't be cast from the battlefield.
2019/11/12: If a card with spellmorph is manifested, you can cast it from the battlefield.
2019/11/12: The face-down characteristics of a permanent are copiable values. If another object becomes a copy of a face-down creature or if a token is created that's a copy of a face-down creature, that new object is a 2/2 colorless face-up creature with no abilities.
2019/11/12: Because face-down creatures don't have a name, they can't have the same name as any other creature or share any creature types with any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2019/11/12: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. If a face-down spell you control leaves the stack other than by resolving, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends. The game doesn't count them as being turned face up when you reveal them this way.
2019/11/12: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix them up on the battlefield to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2019/11/12: There are no cards in this set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2019/11/12: Are you still reading? That's awesome. Face-down cards are tricky. One more ruling to go.
2019/11/12: If an effect tries to return a face-down creature to the battlefield after it leaves (such Momentary Blink or Adarkar Valkyrie's delayed triggered ability), that effect returns the card face up. If it tries to put an instant or sorcery card onto the battlefield this way, that card remains in its current zone instead.</Rulings>

2019/11/12: A triggered ability won't cost less, since there isn't a triggering cost to reduce, but its targets will be chosen randomly.
2019/11/12: Targets are chosen only from among legal targets.
2019/11/12: If a spell or ability has two or more targets where the legality of one or more of those targets depends on what one or more of the other targets are, the targets are chosen at random in the order specified on the card. If choosing one player or object as a target would cause no legal targets to remain for another target, that player or object can't be randomly chosen.
2019/11/12: Targeted spells and abilities cost only {2} less, even if they have more than one target.
2019/11/12: One a spell or ability has had random targets chosen, a player can't choose to not finish casting or activating that spell or ability unless there's no way for the player to complete the process. For example, the player can't choose to not activate mana abilities to pay for the spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: "Summon" isn't a card type. Throat Wolf is a creature.
2019/11/12: As the declare blockers step ends, if any creatures have firstest strike, there's an additional combat step where only those creatures deal damage. The game waits until after this step to determine whether there will be a first-strike combat damage step.
2019/11/12: If a creature with firstest strike enters the battlefield during the firstest-strike combat damage step or the first-strike combat damage step, it deals regular combat damage instead.
2019/11/12: If a creature with firstest strike gains first strike, it deals damage during the first strike and firstest strike combat damage steps. If it gains double strike, it deals damage during all three combat damage steps.
2019/11/12: Throat Wolf's last ability reads like it's pointless. Only Throat Wolf can attack, but it can't attack, so nothing can attack. Rather than assume the text is pointless, this ability should be played as though it read "After each opponent's first combat phase on each turn, you have a combat phase. Only Throat Wolf can attack during that combat phase."
2019/11/12: While it's your combat phase during your opponent's turn, you're the active player and the attacking player. However, any rules or effects that check whose turn it is will still know that it's your opponent's turn.
2019/11/12: If two players each control Throat Wolf, player A's first combat phase will be followed by player B's first combat phase from B's Throat Wolf, which will be followed by player A's second combat from A's Throat Wolf. On player C's turn (where C is the active player and player A is the next player in turn order) player C's combat phase is followed by player A's combat phase, then player B's combat phase following player A's, then player A's following player B's, then player B's that follows player C's finally happens.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>476197</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: Any additional effects that happen while a spell is resolving based on additional or alternative costs, such as buyback and flashback, won't happen.
2019/11/12: Lightning Bolt is an instant with mana cost {R} and the ability "Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target."
2019/11/12: The target spell loses all characteristics printed on the card and has only Lightning Bolt's characteristics. These become the spell's copiable values. Once it resolves, it's put into its owner's graveyard and has its normal characteristics again.
2019/11/12: As the spell becomes Lightning Bolt, it stops having any targets. If the spell's controller doesn't change the spell's target so it has one, the spell won't resolve.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: Geometric Weird's effect sets its power and toughness indefinitely until something sets them to a different number.

2019/11/12: Among abilities, only activated and triggered abilities use the stack. Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts, and some keyword abilities are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.</Rulings>

2019/11/12: The whammy deck exists in the additional deck zone. Since this is a game zone, it's not outside the game (for effects such as that of Frontier Explorer).
2019/11/12: You can't draw cards from the whammy deck or interact with it in any way other than by effects that specifically interact with the whammy deck. Effects that affect cards you own not on the battlefield don't affect cards in the whammy deck.
2019/11/12: You choose a target as you cast Whammy Burn, before revealing any cards from your whammy deck.</Rulings>

<Artist>John Penick</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476208</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: Objects on the interplanar battlefield are on the battlefield and are known as interplanar permanents.
2019/11/12: An interplanar permanent is a permanent that you don't control, but it's not a permanent an opponent controls.
2019/11/12: If an effect refers to an interplanar permanent's controller, that part of the effect doesn't happen.
2019/11/12: If an effect attempts to give a player control of an interplanar permanent, that part of the effect doesn't happen.
2019/11/12: If an interplanar permanent gains an ability that refers to its controller or refers to "you," that part of the ability has no effect.
2019/11/12: If a non-interplanar permanent becomes a copy of an interplanar permanent, the first permanent is still non-interplanar. If an interplanar permanent becomes a copy of a non-interplanar permanent, the first permanent is still interplanar.
2019/11/12: If multiple triggered abilities of interplanar permanents need to be put on the stack, the active player puts them on the stack in any order they choose after all players have put any triggered abilities they control onto the stack. (In other words, the triggered abilities of interplanar permanents will resolve first.) These abilities have no controller.
2019/11/12: If a player attacks with multiple creatures with power 4 or greater, that player chooses one player or planeswalker those creatures are attacking, and Interplanar Brushwagg ends up attacking that player or planeswalker.
2019/11/12: Although Interplanar Brushwagg is an attacking creature if it uses its triggered ability, it was never declared as an attacking creature. This means that abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger when it becomes attacking.
2019/11/12: Any effects that say that Interplanar Brushwagg can't attack or can't attack a certain player (such as that of Propaganda, or if Interplanar Brushwagg gains defender) affect only the declaration of attackers. They won't stop Interplanar Brushwagg from becoming an attacking creature through its triggered ability.
2019/11/12: Interplanar Brushwagg may end up attacking its owner this way.</Rulings>

<CardText>[0]: Exile Kaya, Ghost Haunter haunting target creature for as long as that creature remains on the battlefield.
[-1]: You get an emblem with, "At the beginning of your upkeep, this emblem deals 3 damage to the owner of target haunted creature."
[-2]: You get an emblem with, "At the beginning of your upkeep, gain control of target haunted creature for as long as it remains haunted."</CardText>
<Artist>Sydney Adams</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476224</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: Haunting a creature has no inherent rules meaning. It's a designation that other effects (such as those of Kaya's emblems) may refer to.
2019/11/12: Kaya returns to the battlefield immediately after the creature she haunts leaves the battlefield. When she returns this way, she's considered a new object and enters with her starting loyalty counters.
2019/11/12: If Kaya somehow leaves exile, the creature is no longer haunted. Similarly, if Kaya isn't exiled by her first ability as it resolves, the creature isn't haunted.
2019/11/12: Kaya's emblems can target a creature that's haunted by anything, not just by Kaya.</Rulings>

<Artist>Cynthia Sheppard</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476225</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: A creature is modified if its text has been changed to modify its abilities, if it has gained or lost any abilities, or if a counter or an effect has set or changed its power or toughness.
2019/11/12: Most copy effects will cause a creature to be modified, although in some unusual cases the copy effect will leave it with the same power, toughness, and abilities. For example, a Runeclaw Bear that becomes a copy of Glory Seeker will, oddly enough, not be modified.
2019/11/12: If an effect only defined a * or ? symbol in a creature's power or toughness, it isn't modified.
2019/11/12: A creature isn't modified if its controller, color, or types have been changed.
2019/11/12: A token's "printed" abilities, power, and toughness are the values it was created with.
2019/11/12: A face-down permanent's "printed" power and toughness are 2. It has no abilities.
2019/11/12: Certain kinds of cards (such as flip cards, adventurer cards, and double-, triple-, and four-faced cards) define alternative characteristics for those objects under certain circumstances. Using these alternative characteristics doesn't count as being modified.</Rulings>

• Each player discards their hand.
• Planeswalk to Pools of Becoming. (Once there, you can roll the planar die only if you're playing Planechase.)
• For each opponent, exile cards from the top of their library until you exile a nonland card. You may cast those cards without paying their mana costs.
• Destroy all creatures and non-Bolas planeswalkers.
• You get an emblem with "You can cast nonland cards from your sideboard."</CardText>
<Artist>Matt Warren</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476228</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: You can't choose to roll a planar die (which would allow you to leave the Pools of Becoming or trigger its last ability) unless you're playing a Planechase game.
2019/11/12: There's no way to leave Pools of Becoming other than by rolling a planar die or finding an effect that instructs you to planeswalk.
2019/11/12: One a spell or ability has had a random mode chosen, a player can't choose to not finish casting or activating that spell or ability unless there's no way for the player to complete the process. For example, the player can't choose to not activate mana abilities to pay for the spell.
2019/11/12: Pools of Becoming is a plane card that reads "At the beginning of your end step, put the cards in your hand on the bottom of your library in any order, then draw that many cards" and "Whenever you roll CHAOS, reveal the top three cards of your planar deck. Each of the revealed cards' CHAOS abilities triggers. Then put the revealed cards on the bottom of your planar deck in any order." The second ability can't trigger unless you roll a planar die.
2019/11/12: You planeswalk to Pools of Becoming even if you're not playing a Planechase game. This planeswalk isn't represented by a plane card. If you are playing a Planechase game, you planeswalk away from the current plane but you don't reveal the top card of any planar deck.
2019/11/12: Each player controls the current plane card during their turn.
2019/11/12: One card (Fractured Powerstone) allows you to roll the planar die even if you're not playing a Planechase game as long as you've already planeswalked to a plane card. If you roll the Planeswalker symbol outside of a Planechase game, you'll planeswalk away from Pools of Becoming, but you won't planeswalk to a new plane. You're totally lost, which tends to work out well.
2019/11/12: If Bolas has you choose the fourth mode, you can't play land cards exiled this way.
2019/11/12: You must cast any of the exiled cards you wish to cast while Seek Bolas's Counsel is resolving. You can't cast them later in the turn.
2019/11/12: If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2019/11/12: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, you must pay those to cast the card.
2019/11/12: The last mode's emblem doesn't change when you can cast cards from your sideboard.
2019/11/12: In a Limited event, each card a player opened (in a Sealed Deck event) or drafted (in a Booster Draft event) is their sideboard.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: {C} can be paid only with one colorless mana.
2019/11/12: Devoid means "This object is colorless."
2019/11/12: Due to the carefully calibrated system of layers that Magic uses to determine the interaction of continuous effects, gaining an ability that changes the color of an object has no effect on the color of that object. Despite this, Slivdrazi Monstrosity causes Slivers to become colorless as they gain devoid. Rather than try to figure out how this could work, this card should just be played as though it read "Slivers you control have devoid and annihilator 1 and are colorless."
2019/11/12: Annihilator 1 means "Whenever this creature attacks, defending player sacrifices a permanent."
2019/11/12: If a creature is attacking a planeswalker, the planeswalker's controller is the defending player.
2019/11/12: If a creature attacks a planeswalker and that planeswalker leaves the battlefield, the creature continues to attack. If it's blocked, it'll deal combat damage as normal, but if it's unblocked, it won't deal any combat damage.
2019/11/12: Slivdrazi Monstrosity's ability affects itself, causing it to become colorless and gain devoid and annihilator 1 while it's on the battlefield. While not on the battlefield, it's all colors.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/11/12: If Domesticated Watercourse is attached to a creature when it stops being an Equipment, it becomes unattached.
2019/11/12: While Domesticated Watercourse is an Equipment, it can still be tapped to activate its mana ability, even if it's attached to a creature and even though it's no longer a land.
2019/11/12: You can activate Domesticated Watercourse's mana ability to pay for its activated ability. Being tapped won't affect its abilities as an Equipment.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>476246</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: Nodes remain permanently marked on the physical card. They're not removed as it becomes a new object or as the game ends.
2019/11/12: If an object without nodes becomes a copy of an object with nodes, the copy has no nodes. A cost to mark one of its nodes can't be paid.
2019/11/12: If an object with nodes becomes a copy of another object with nodes, the nodes on the physical card that's the copy will be marked if the legacy abilities it gains instruct you to mark a node. Thus far, this ruling applies only to the case where one Gold Mine becomes a copy of another Gold Mine.</Rulings>

<Name>Jasconian Isle</Name>
<Type>Land Creature — Island Fish 3/4</Type>
<CardText>(Jasconian Isle isn't a spell, it's affected by summoning sickness, it's blue, and it has "{T}: Add {U}.")
Jasconian Isle enters the battlefield tapped.
Jasconian Isle doesn't untap during your untap step.
At the beginning of your upkeep, you may pay {U}{U}. If you do, untap Jasconian Isle.</CardText>
<Artist>Aaron Reed</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476247</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/11/12: If Jasconian Isle is changed into another basic land type (such as by Cyclopean Titan), it continues to be a 3/4 creature and a Fish, but it loses all of its abilities.
2019/11/12: This card will have a blue color indicator, which will make it blue. That's why the reminder text says so. Color indicators are added later in editing.
2019/11/12: Playing Jasconian Isle as a land uses a land drop, the same as playing an artifact land or enchantment land.
2019/11/12: If an effect allows you to cast a creature spell, you can't play Jasconian Isle that way.</Rulings>

2019/11/12: If you take a mulligan, you don't shuffle Rift into your library. You draw six cards instead of seven, then the mulligan procedure continues as normal.</Rulings>
