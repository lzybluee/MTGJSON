2021/04/16: You can name either face of a modal double-faced card, but not both, and you can name either half of a split card, but not both. Opponents may still cast the face or half you didn't name.
2021/04/16: If you target a noncreature permanent with the second mode and it later becomes a creature, that creature still won't be able to attack or block until your next turn.
2021/04/16: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have a colon in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected.

<Rulings>2021/04/16: The mana value of a spell on the stack is determined by its mana cost, not any alternative costs you used to pay for it.
2021/04/16: If you choose to pay one alternative cost, you can't pay any other alternative costs. For example, if an effect lets you cast a "Mastery" spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't also choose to pay its given alternative cost.
2021/04/16: If an effect increases or decreases the cost of spells you cast, that cost increase or decrease is applied to the alternative cost you chose to pay. In that case, the cost was still paid for the purposes of the effect, even if you paid more or less for it when it was cast.
2021/04/16: If you copy a "Mastery" spell and the alternative cost was paid, the copy will resolve as though the cost was paid.

2021/04/16: Abilities that trigger when something else causes an ability to trigger will always go on the stack after the ability that caused them to trigger.

<Rulings>2021/04/16: Symmetry Sage's triggered ability overwrites all previous effects that set the target creature's power to a specific value. Other effects that set its power to specific values that start to apply after this ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
2021/04/16: Any effects that modify a creature's power without setting it to a specific value (i.e. ones that don't affect base power) will apply after its base power is set, regardless of the order those effects were created. The same is true for counters that modify its power.
2021/04/16: Each magecraft ability has a different effect, although they all have the same trigger condition, whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell.
2021/04/16: For example, if you control Archmage Emeritus and cast an instant or sorcery spell, Archmage Emeritus's magecraft ability will trigger and you will draw a card.
2021/04/16: If an effect creates a copy of an instant or sorcery spell, this will also cause the magecraft ability to trigger.
2021/04/16: If an effect creates multiple copies of an instant or sorcery spell, magecraft abilities trigger once for each copy created by the effect.
2021/04/16: Some effects instruct you to copy an instant or sorcery card in a zone other than the stack. These copies do not cause magecraft abilities to trigger. However, most effects that do this also allow you to cast the copy, and casting the copy will cause magecraft abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

2021/04/16: If an effect increases or decreases the cost of spells you cast, that cost increase or decrease is applied to the alternative cost you chose to pay. In that case, the cost was still paid for the purposes of the effect, even if you paid more or less for it when it was cast.

<CardText>Magecraft — Whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell, each opponent loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.
[+1]: You lose 1 life. Look at the top three cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the rest into your graveyard.
[-3]: Each opponent sacrifices a creature with the greatest power among creatures that player controls.
[-8]: Each opponent may discard a card. If they don't, they lose 3 life. Repeat this process six more times.</CardText>
<Artist>Kieran Yanner</Artist>
<Multiverseid>513560</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: For Professor Onyx's second loyalty ability, if an opponent has multiple creatures with the greatest power, that player choose which one to sacrifice. The next opponent in turn order chooses which creature they are sacrificing, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
2021/04/16: For Professor Onyx's last loyalty ability, "this process" is the following: First, the next opponent in turn order may choose a card in hand without revealing it, then each other opponent in turn order does the same. Then all the chosen cards are revealed and discarded at the same time and each opponent who didn't discard a card (whether they chose not to or had an empty hand) loses 3 life. This all will happen seven times, for a maximum loss of 21 life per opponent.
2021/04/16: If Professor Onyx seems familiar, it's probably because you've seen this type of planeswalker before.
2021/04/16: Each magecraft ability has a different effect, although they all have the same trigger condition, whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell.
2021/04/16: For example, if you control Archmage Emeritus and cast an instant or sorcery spell, Archmage Emeritus's magecraft ability will trigger and you will draw a card.
2021/04/16: If an effect creates a copy of an instant or sorcery spell, this will also cause the magecraft ability to trigger.
2021/04/16: If an effect creates multiple copies of an instant or sorcery spell, magecraft abilities trigger once for each copy created by the effect.
2021/04/16: Some effects instruct you to copy an instant or sorcery card in a zone other than the stack. These copies do not cause magecraft abilities to trigger. However, most effects that do this also allow you to cast the copy, and casting the copy will cause magecraft abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/04/16: If the {2}{R}{R} cost was paid, the opponent chooses how many and which cards to discard as Fervent Mastery resolves. They may choose to discard no cards.
2021/04/16: The mana value of a spell on the stack is determined by its mana cost, not any alternative costs you used to pay for it.
2021/04/16: If you choose to pay one alternative cost, you can't pay any other alternative costs. For example, if an effect lets you cast a "Mastery" spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't also choose to pay its given alternative cost.
2021/04/16: If an effect increases or decreases the cost of spells you cast, that cost increase or decrease is applied to the alternative cost you chose to pay. In that case, the cost was still paid for the purposes of the effect, even if you paid more or less for it when it was cast.
2021/04/16: If you copy a "Mastery" spell and the alternative cost was paid, the copy will resolve as though the cost was paid.
2021/04/16: In a multiplayer game, you choose which opponent takes the prescribed action as the spell resolves.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>513588</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: Excess damage caused by a spell or ability is similar to how combat damage from a creature with trample is handled. Start with the amount of damage being dealt to the creature and determine what is "lethal." This is the creature's toughness minus the amount of damage that it already has marked on it, but ignoring any replacement or prevention effects that will modify this damage. Also ignore whether the creature has an ability such as indestructible that will result in it not being destroyed by this damage.
2021/04/16: Once you've determined how much damage is excess, Pigment Storm simultaneously deals damage to the creature and to its controller. This damage may be modified by replacement or prevention effects.
2021/04/16: If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Pigment Storm tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. It won't deal damage to any player.
2021/04/16: Pigment Storm's replacement effect is a self-replacement effect. It is applied before any other replacement effects that would change the amount of damage dealt to the target creature and its controller.</Rulings>

2021/04/16: If an effect creates multiple copies of an instant or sorcery spell, magecraft abilities trigger once for each copy created by the effect.
2021/04/16: Some effects instruct you to copy an instant or sorcery card in a zone other than the stack. These copies do not cause magecraft abilities to trigger. However, most effects that do this also allow you to cast the copy, and casting the copy will cause magecraft abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

2021/04/16: Exponential Growth doubles a creature's power sequentially, not all at the same time. For example, if X is 3 and you target a 2/2 creature, you will double its power once to 4, again to 8, and a third time to 16, making it a 16/2 creature until end of turn.
2021/04/16: If a creature's power is less than 0 when it's doubled, instead that creature gets -X/-0, where X is how much less than 0 its power is. For example, if an effect has given a 5/5 creature -7/-0 so that it's a -2/5 creature, doubling its power makes it a -4/5 creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/04/16: Because damage remains marked on creatures until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Augmenter Pugilist may become lethal if the number of lands you control falls below eight.
2021/04/16: Echoing Equation copies the printed values of the target creature. It won't copy any counters on that creature or any effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on, and a creature becoming a copy doesn't remove any such counters or effects that are already applying to it. Notably, Echoing Equation won't copy any type-changing effects that are currently making the target a creature. For example, if you choose a land that's become a creature, all your other creatures will become noncreature lands until end of turn.
2021/04/16: If the chosen creature is copying something else, other creatures you control become copies of whatever the chosen creature is copying.
2021/04/16: If the target creature is a token, other creatures you control will copy the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Any of those creatures that aren't tokens won't become tokens in this case. Similarly, if the target creature is a nontoken creature, creature tokens you control won't stop being tokens.
2021/04/16: Echoing Equation affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures that come under your control later in the turn won't be copies of the chosen creature.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>513628</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: Returning a nonlegendary creature card is not optional. If there is at least one in your graveyard, you must target it with the magecraft ability.
2021/04/16: Awaken the Blood Avatar's first ability can't reduce its cost below {B}{R}. However, you can sacrifice any number of creatures, even if they won't reduce its cost any further.
2021/04/16: Include any additional costs to cast Awaken the Blood Avatar before applying its own cost reduction. For example, if Extus is your commander, and an additional cost of {6} applies from the "commander tax," you may cast Awaken the Blood Avatar by sacrificing four creatures and paying {4}{B}{R}.
2021/04/16: As Awaken the Blood Avatar resolves, first the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's an opponent's turn, the opponent whose turn it is) chooses a creature they control, then each other opponent in turn order does the same knowing the choices made before them. Then all the chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
2021/04/16: The Blood Avatar will be awakened even if no player has creatures to sacrifice when it resolves.
2021/04/16: Each magecraft ability has a different effect, although they all have the same trigger condition, whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell.
2021/04/16: For example, if you control Archmage Emeritus and cast an instant or sorcery spell, Archmage Emeritus's magecraft ability will trigger and you will draw a card.

<Rulings>2021/04/16: Elemental Expressionist has received an update to its Oracle text. The official text is listed above. Specifically, the second ability granted to the target creature doesn't care that the creature's controller is the one exiling it. If the creature is put into exile for any reason, that ability will trigger.
2021/04/16: If you target a creature token with Elemental Expressionist's ability, and that token would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled (very briefly) before it ceases to exist, and you will still create an Elemental token.
2021/04/16: If the magecraft ability triggers and resolves more than once with the same creature as the target, that creature will have multiple instances of each of the two triggered abilities the magecraft ability grants it. Each instance of the second ability will trigger separately, and you'll create an Elemental token for each of them. (Multiple instances of the first granted ability are redundant.)
2021/04/16: Each magecraft ability has a different effect, although they all have the same trigger condition, whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell.
2021/04/16: For example, if you control Archmage Emeritus and cast an instant or sorcery spell, Archmage Emeritus's magecraft ability will trigger and you will draw a card.
2021/04/16: If an effect creates a copy of an instant or sorcery spell, this will also cause the magecraft ability to trigger.
2021/04/16: If an effect creates multiple copies of an instant or sorcery spell, magecraft abilities trigger once for each copy created by the effect.
2021/04/16: Some effects instruct you to copy an instant or sorcery card in a zone other than the stack. These copies do not cause magecraft abilities to trigger. However, most effects that do this also allow you to cast the copy, and casting the copy will cause magecraft abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

<CardText>Spirits you control get +1/+1 and have trample and haste.
Whenever another nontoken creature you control dies, exile it. If you do, create a token that's a copy of that creature, except it's a Spirit in addition to its other types and it has "When this creature leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to its owner's graveyard."</CardText>
<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Watermark>Lorehold</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>513684</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: Hofri Ghostforge's last ability is linked to the ability it grants the Spirit token. If a replacement effect causes you to create more than one Spirit token with this effect, they will all have that ability, and the exiled card will be returned to the graveyard if any of them leaves the battlefield.
2021/04/16: If another creature enters the battlefield as a copy of the Spirit token or another effect creates a copy of the Spirit token, it will have the triggered ability granted by Hofri, but will not be linked to Hofri's ability and will not return the card to the graveyard when it leaves the battlefield.
2021/04/16: Each Spirit token you create refers only to the card you exile during the resolution of the ability that created that token. When it leaves the battlefield, you return only that card to your graveyard, not any other card exiled by Hofri.
2021/04/16: If you can't exile the card, perhaps because another effect moved the card before the triggered ability started resolving, you won't create a token.
2021/04/16: The copy uses the copiable values of the creature as it last existed on the battlefield before it died, not as it existed in the graveyard before it was exiled.
2021/04/16: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless the creature was copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2021/04/16: If the copied creature was copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2021/04/16: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the creature will also work.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/04/16: Spiteful Squad's ability doesn't cause you to move counters from itself to the target creature. Rather, you put the same number of each kind of counter Spiteful Squad had when it died onto that creature.
2021/04/16: In some unusual cases, you may end up putting the appropriate counters on more than one permanent. For example, if you control The Ozolith when Spiteful Squad dies, you will put the appropriate number of each kind of counter onto both The Ozolith and the target creature.
2021/04/16: If Spiteful Squad has -1/-1 counters on it when it dies, the last ability will include those as well. This may result in the recipient also dying. Spiteful indeed.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/04/16: "That player" refers to the opponent who was dealt damage.
2021/04/16: If multiple creatures deal combat damage to you or an opponent at the same time, the appropriate ability of Strixhaven Stadium will trigger that many times. You can put these abilities on the stack in any order. The last ability put on the stack will be the first to resolve.
2021/04/16: In a multiplayer game, if creatures you control deal combat damage to multiple opponents at the same time, the last ability will trigger multiple times. However, because the counters are removed, it is difficult (but not impossible) to make multiple players lose the game from this ability in the same combat phase.
2021/04/16: The check for ten or more point counters happens only as the last ability is resolving. Notably, if you add the tenth point counter some other way, no one will lose the game . . . yet.</Rulings>
