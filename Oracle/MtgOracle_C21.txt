<Rulings>2021/04/16: If the attacking player is one of your opponents and has less life than the player being attacked, then the condition is satisfied.

2021/04/16: You choose which creature to put +1/+1 counters on as the ability is resolving. Once you make the choice, no player may take actions until the counters are placed.</Rulings>

Mentor (Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature with lesser power.)

<Watermark>Silverquill</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>518308</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: The last ability counts the number of all kinds of counters, not just +1/+1 counters.
2021/04/16: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2021/04/16: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2021/04/16: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>518309</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: Veyran, Voice of Duality's last ability causes each of your magecraft abilities, including Veyran's own, to trigger an additional time.
2021/04/16: Veyran's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger again. Any choices you make as you put the ability on the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution are also made individually.
2021/04/16: If you somehow control two Veyrans (which would be poetic), you casting an instant or sorcery spell causes abilities to trigger three times. A third Veyran (less poetic) causes abilities to trigger four times, and so on.
2021/04/16: Each magecraft ability has a different effect, although they all have the same trigger condition, whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell.
2021/04/16: For example, if you control Archmage Emeritus and cast an instant or sorcery spell, Archmage Emeritus's magecraft ability will trigger and you will draw a card.
2021/04/16: If an effect creates a copy of an instant or sorcery spell, this will also cause the magecraft ability to trigger.
2021/04/16: If an effect creates multiple copies of an instant or sorcery spell, magecraft abilities trigger once for each copy created by the effect.
2021/04/16: Some effects instruct you to copy an instant or sorcery card in a zone other than the stack. These copies do not cause magecraft abilities to trigger. However, most effects that do this also allow you to cast the copy, and casting the copy will cause magecraft abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

2021/04/16: If the spell requires targets, you choose the target of the original spell as you cast it. If you create a copy of the spell, you may choose new targets for the copy as you create that copy. Similarly, the opponent you chose to create a copy may choose new targets for that copy as it's created. In other words, your opponent will know the targets of your original spell and your copy when choosing the new targets, if any, for their copy.

<Rulings>2021/04/16: In a two-player game, the chosen player won't be much of a secret.

2021/04/16: If you control more than one Guardian Archon, you may choose a different opponent for each one. Be careful to keep track of which opponent is chosen for each Guardian Archon.
2021/04/16: If Guardian Archon leaves the battlefield and returns, it's considered a new object. You may choose a new opponent and you may activate its last ability again.
2021/04/16: If you didn't choose an opponent as Guardian Archon entered the battlefield, you can't pay the cost to activate the last ability. This will usually happen because you gained control of another player's Guardian Archon or because a creature already on the battlefield became a copy of Guardian Archon.
2021/04/16: Protection from a player means all of the following: (1) Neither you nor the target permanent can be the target of spells or abilities controlled by the chosen player. (2) Neither you nor the target permanent can be enchanted or equipped by any Auras or Equipment controlled by the chosen players. (Okay, Fortifications too, if the target permanent is a land.) (3) If the target permanent is a creature, it can't be blocked by creatures controlled by the chosen player. (4) All damage that would be dealt to you or the target permanent by sources controlled by the chosen player is prevented. The same is true for sources owned by the chosen player that don't have controllers.</Rulings>

Whenever Dazzling Sphinx deals combat damage to a player, that player exiles cards from the top of their library until they exile an instant or sorcery card.

<Artist>Izzy</Artist>
<Multiverseid>518423</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Revel in Silence's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/04/16: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/04/16: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/04/16: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/04/16: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/04/16: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/04/16: If you can't cast the card for any reason, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.</Rulings>

2021/04/16: You may only pay {B} once for each life gain event.
2021/04/16: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2021/04/16: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability will trigger only once.</Rulings>

2021/04/16: Cursed Mirror copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its types, color, power and toughness, and so on.
2021/04/16: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2021/04/16: If the copied creature is copying something else, then Cursed Mirror enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever that creature is copying.
2021/04/16: If the copied creature is a token, Cursed Mirror copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Copying a token doesn't make Cursed Mirror a token. Similarly, if Cursed Mirror itself is a token, copying a nontoken permanent doesn't make it stop being a token.

<Multiverseid>518452</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Revel in Silence's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2021/04/16: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2021/04/16: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2021/04/16: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2021/04/16: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2021/04/16: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2021/04/16: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2021/04/16: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever Ruxa, Patient Professor enters the battlefield or attacks, return target creature card with no abilities from your graveyard to your hand.
Creatures you control with no abilities get +1/+1.

<Artist>Ilse Gort</Artist>
<Multiverseid>518462</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: A creature or creature card with no abilities is one with no rules text at all. This includes true vanilla creatures (including Grizzly Bears, Runeclaw Bear, Bear Cub, and other adorable bear students), face-down creatures, many tokens, and creatures that have lost their abilities. Abilities that function only in zones other than the battlefield count. For example, a creature with cycling {2} is not a creature with no abilities.
2021/04/16: Notably, neither of Ruxa's last two abilities give any creatures an ability.
2021/04/16: Auras and Equipment that grant abilities will use the words "gains" or "has," and they'll list a keyword ability or an ability in quotation marks. A creature with no abilities affected by such an Aura or Equipment would no longer get the +1/+1 bonus or be able to assign combat damage as though it weren't blocked. If the Aura or Equipment does not give the creature any abilities, the creature will continue to benefit from Ruxa's last two abilities.
2021/04/16: For each attacking creature you control with no abilities, you decide whether it will assign combat damage to the blocking creatures or if it will assign combat damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking. You can't split damage assignment between them. You make this decision individually for each qualifying creature just before it deals combat damage.</Rulings>

<Artist>Filip Burburan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>518464</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/04/16: Sproutback Trudge's ability counts the total amount of life gained without considering any life you lost during that turn. For example, if you lost 3 life and gained 4 life earlier in the turn, Sproutback Trudge will cost {3}{G}{G}.
2021/04/16: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Sproutback Trudge's first ability). Sproutback Trudge's mana value is always 9, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.
2021/04/16: The cost reduction can reduce only generic mana in a spell's total cost. It can't reduce the cost to cast Sproutback Trudge beyond {G}{G}.
2021/04/16: You still need to pay the cost to cast Sproutback Trudge from your graveyard.
2021/04/16: You need to gain life before the end step begins for the last ability to trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/04/16: An ability that triggers "whenever you gain life" triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life you gain.
2021/04/16: You may only pay {2} once for each life gain event.
2021/04/16: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2021/04/16: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability will trigger only once.</Rulings>
