<Multiverseid>527290</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: Phased out permanents are treated as though they don't exist. They can't be the target of spells or abilities, their static abilities have no effect on the game, their triggered abilities can't trigger, they can't attack or block, and so on.
2021/07/23: As Blink Dog phases out, Auras and Equipment attached to it also phase out at the same time. Those Auras and Equipment will phase in at the same time Blink Dog does, and they'll phase in still attached to Blink Dog.
2021/07/23: Permanents phase back in during their controller's untap step, immediately before that player untaps their permanents. Creatures that phase in this way are able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn. If a permanent had counters on it when it phased out, it will have those counters when it phases back in.
2021/07/23: An attacking or blocking creature that phases out is removed from combat.
2021/07/23: Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
2021/07/23: Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration, such as that of Mind Flayer, ignore phased-out objects. If ignoring those objects causes the effect's conditions to no longer be met, the duration will expire.
2021/07/23: Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
2021/07/23: If an opponent gains control of your Blink Dog, activates its Teleport ability, and the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases in, Blink Dog phases in under your control as that opponent's next untap step begins. If they leave the game before their next untap step, Blink Dog phases in as the next untap step begins after their turn would have begun.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life gain event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, you will gain 2 additional life from Cleric Class's first ability and its level 2 ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), you will only gain 1 additional life and the ability will trigger only once.
2021/07/23: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability will trigger only once.
2021/07/23: When Cleric Class's level 3 ability resolves, you gain life equal to the creature's toughness as it exists on battlefield, which may be different than its toughness in the graveyard.
2021/07/23: Each Class has five abilities. The three in the major sections of its text box are class abilities. Class abilities can be static, activated, or triggered abilities. The other two are level abilities, one activated ability to advance the Class to level 2 and another to advance the Class to level 3.
2021/07/23: Each Class starts with only the first of three class abilities. As the first level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 2 and gains the second class ability. As the second level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 3 and gains the third class ability.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level won't remove abilities that a Class had at a previous level.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level is a normal activated ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
2021/07/23: You can't activate the first level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 1. Similarly, you can't activate the second level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 2.
2021/07/23: Some Class cards have an effect that increases when more are under your control. For example, if you have multiple Barbarian Class cards, you roll that many additional dice and ignore that many of the lowest rolls.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: Revealing a Dragon card happens as Dragon's Disciple resolves. It is not an additional cost for casting the spell.
2021/07/23: If you choose to reveal a Dragon card from your hand and also control a Dragon, Dragon's Disciple still only gets a single +1/+1 counter.
2021/07/23: Players can respond to Dragon's Disciple while it is on the stack, but they cannot respond to the choice of whether or not to reveal a Dragon as it enters the battlefield.

2021/07/23: If an opponent gains control of one of your creatures, that creature phases out, and the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases back in, that creature phases in under your control as that opponent's next untap step begins. If they leave the game before their next untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after their turn would have begun.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: If Paladin Class is level 3 and you attack with exactly one creature, it won't get a power and toughness bonus, but it will get double strike.
2021/07/23: Each Class has five abilities. The three in the major sections of its text box are class abilities. Class abilities can be static, activated, or triggered abilities. The other two are level abilities, one activated ability to advance the Class to level 2 and another to advance the Class to level 3.
2021/07/23: Each Class starts with only the first of three class abilities. As the first level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 2 and gains the second class ability. As the second level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 3 and gains the third class ability.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level won't remove abilities that a Class had at a previous level.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level is a normal activated ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
2021/07/23: You can't activate the first level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 1. Similarly, you can't activate the second level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 2.
2021/07/23: You can multiclass or even control multiple Class enchantments of the same class. Each Class permanent tracks its own level separately.
2021/07/23: Some Class cards have an effect that increases when more are under your control. For example, if you have multiple Barbarian Class cards, you roll that many additional dice and ignore that many of the lowest rolls.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: If an Aura is exiled this way, its owner chooses what it will enchant as it returns to the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to a permanent with shroud, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains in exile for the rest of the game.

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: To venture into the dungeon, a player moves their venture marker into the next room of the dungeon they are currently in. If they aren't currently in a dungeon, that player instead chooses a dungeon card from outside the game, puts it into the command zone, and moves their venture marker onto the first room.
2021/07/23: Moving into a dungeon room will cause its room ability to trigger.

2021/07/23: The player venturing into the dungeon chooses which dungeon they will venture into. They may choose a dungeon that they have already completed this game.
2021/07/23: Dungeon cards are not part of a player's deck or sideboard. In both constructed and limited formats, players can use any dungeon card when they venture into the dungeon.
2021/07/23: You can only move forward (well, downward) in a dungeon, never backwards or sideways.
2021/07/23: Dungeons are removed from the game as a state-based action.
2021/07/23: If you somehow venture into the dungeon while a room's ability is on the stack, you will continue on in the dungeon. If you're already in the last room, complete that dungeon and start a new one.
2021/07/23: Choosing the dungeon or room to venture into is part of resolving the venture into the dungeon keyword action. Once that choice is made, players may not respond until after the appropriate room ability has triggered.</Rulings>

For example, if you're required to pay an additional {1} to cast Demilich (perhaps because of Sphere of Resistance), and you've cast five or more instant and/or sorcery spells this turn, you would pay {0} to cast Demilich.
2021/07/23: If you exile a card as the triggered ability resolves, that card will remain exiled whether you cast the copy or not.
2021/07/23: Casting the copy happens as part of the resolution of Demilich's triggered ability. If you choose to cast it, you must do so right away. If you choose not to cast it right away, the copy ceases to exist the next time a player would receive priority.
2021/07/23: You must pay all normal costs for casting the copy.

<Rulings>2021/07/23: If a spell or ability an opponent controls targets Iymrith, Desert Doom while it is tapped, finding a way to untap it in response will not cause its ward ability to trigger.
2021/07/23: If a player casts a spell that targets multiple permanents their opponent controls with ward, each of those ward abilities will trigger. If that player doesn't pay for all of them, the spell will be countered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kim Sokol</Artist>
<Multiverseid>527355</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: If the enchanted creature is red (or if it becomes red), it loses all abilities that it had prior to the time Ray of Frost became attached to it. It will keep any abilities that were granted to it after Ray of Frost became attached to it.
2021/07/23: If the enchanted creature is red and has a characteristic-defining ability that specifies its types or colors, that ability will still have its effect because it's applied before the creature loses the ability.
2021/07/23: If the enchanted creature is red and has a characteristic-defining ability that specifies its power and/or toughness, that ability will not have its effect. In that case, its power and/or toughness (as appropriate) become 0.
2021/07/23: Some noncreature permanents, such as Grand Master of Flowers, become creatures because of a static ability they have. If Ray of Frost becomes attached to such a creature and that creature is red or becomes red, that permanent will remain a creature even though it loses the ability that is making it a creature after that ability applies.</Rulings>

It won't copy counters on that permanent or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2021/07/23: If the first target permanent copies a permanent that's copying something else, it will become whatever the second target is copying.
2021/07/23: If an effect begins to apply to the first target permanent before it becomes a copy of another permanent, that effect will continue to apply.

<Rulings>2021/07/23: If your result is 1-9, you must still pay all costs to cast the copy. You may pay any additional or alternative costs the spell has. If it has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid.
2021/07/23: If your result is 10-19, you may pay {1} instead of its mana cost. You cannot pay its regular mana cost or any alternative costs the copy has. You may pay any additional costs and must pay mandatory additional costs.
2021/07/23: If your result is 20, you may cast the copies without paying their mana costs. You cannot pay their regular mana costs or any alternative costs the copies have. You may pay any additional costs and must pay mandatory additional costs. You may cast the copies in any order you choose.
2021/07/23: In all cases, any copies you don't cast cease to exist after the ability is finished resolving.
2021/07/23: If you control multiple copies of Wizard's Spellbook, each one tracks the cards it has exiled separately.
2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: The player venturing into the dungeon chooses which dungeon they will venture into. They may choose a dungeon that they have already completed this game.
2021/07/23: Dungeon cards are not part of a player's deck or sideboard. In both constructed and limited formats, players can use any dungeon card when they venture into the dungeon.
2021/07/23: You can only move forward (well, downward) in a dungeon, never backwards or sideways.

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Acererak the Archlich has an intervening if clause in its first triggered ability. If you have completed Tomb of Annihilation, the ability won't trigger at all. If it does trigger, but you somehow complete Tomb of Annihilation while the ability is on the stack, then the ability won't do anything. You won't return Acererak to its owner's hand and you won't venture into the dungeon.
2021/07/23: If Acererak is no longer on the battlefield as its first ability resolves and you haven't completed Tomb of Annihilation, you will still venture into the dungeon.
2021/07/23: In a multiplayer game, each opponent decides in turn order whether or not they will sacrifice a creature and which one they will sacrifice. Each opponent knows the choices made before they make their own choice. Then, once all opponents have chosen, creatures are sacrificed and tokens are created simultaneously.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: The Book of Vile Darkness has received an update. The current Oracle text appears above. Specifically, the triggered abilities that Vecna gains are part of its copiable values. This means any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities it gains (such as the one from Eye of Vecna) will trigger.
2021/07/23: In the vast majority of cases, Vecna will gain the triggered ability printed on Hand of Vecna and the two triggered abilities printed on Eye of Vecna.
2021/07/23: In some strange cases, you might make something into a copy of the Eye and/or Hand of Vecna and then exile that copy to activate The Book of Vile Darkness's ability. The ability that creates Vecna will look at the cards in exile, not the permanents on the battlefield, so it's possible to have Vecna gain different triggered abilities.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

However, if no creatures have died so far this turn as the end step begins, the ability won't trigger at all. It's not possible to cause a creature to die during the end step in time to have the ability trigger.
2021/07/23: Each Class has five abilities. The three in the major sections of its text box are class abilities. Class abilities can be static, activated, or triggered abilities. The other two are level abilities, one activated ability to advance the Class to level 2 and another to advance the Class to level 3.
2021/07/23: Each Class starts with only the first of three class abilities. As the first level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 2 and gains the second class ability. As the second level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 3 and gains the third class ability.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level won't remove abilities that a Class had at a previous level.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level is a normal activated ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
2021/07/23: You can't activate the first level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 1. Similarly, you can't activate the second level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 2.
2021/07/23: You can multiclass or even control multiple Class enchantments of the same class. Each Class permanent tracks its own level separately.
2021/07/23: Some Class cards have an effect that increases when more are under your control. For example, if you have multiple Barbarian Class cards, you roll that many additional dice and ignore that many of the lowest rolls.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: If you do not play the exiled cards on the turn that they are exiled, they remain exiled indefinitely.
2021/07/23: Normal costs and timing permissions apply to cards played this way. Unless an effect says you can play additional lands during your turn, you cannot play a land exiled this way if you have already played one this turn.
2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Players decide in turn order, starting with the active player (or the next opponent in turn order if the active player isn't sacrificing anything), which permanent(s) they will sacrifice. Players later in turn order will know which permanents were picked by earlier players while they make this choice. Once all choices have been made, all permanents are sacrificed simultaneously.
2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: To venture into the dungeon, a player moves their venture marker into the next room of the dungeon they are currently in. If they aren't currently in a dungeon, that player instead chooses a dungeon card from outside the game, puts it into the command zone, and moves their venture marker onto the first room.
2021/07/23: Moving into a dungeon room will cause its room ability to trigger.
2021/07/23: Once you resolve the last room ability of a dungeon, that dungeon is now completed and is removed from the game.
2021/07/23: A player may only have one dungeon in the command zone at a time.
2021/07/23: The player venturing into the dungeon chooses which dungeon they will venture into. They may choose a dungeon that they have already completed this game.
2021/07/23: Dungeon cards are not part of a player's deck or sideboard. In both constructed and limited formats, players can use any dungeon card when they venture into the dungeon.
2021/07/23: You can only move forward (well, downward) in a dungeon, never backwards or sideways.
2021/07/23: Dungeons are removed from the game as a state-based action.
2021/07/23: If you somehow venture into the dungeon while a room's ability is on the stack, you will continue on in the dungeon. If you're already in the last room, complete that dungeon and start a new one.
2021/07/23: Choosing the dungeon or room to venture into is part of resolving the venture into the dungeon keyword action. Once that choice is made, players may not respond until after the appropriate room ability has triggered.</Rulings>

<Artist>Suzanne Helmigh</Artist>
<Multiverseid>527489</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: The triggered ability Ranger Class gets at level 2 can trigger only once per combat, no matter how many creatures you attack with.
2021/07/23: If Ranger Class is level 3, you can look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction; see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
2021/07/23: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish doing so. This means that if you cast a spell from the top of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
2021/07/23: Ranger Class doesn't change when you can cast creature spells. Normally, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty, although flash may change this.
2021/07/23: You'll still pay all costs for the spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs if any are available.
2021/07/23: Each Class has five abilities. The three in the major sections of its text box are class abilities. Class abilities can be static, activated, or triggered abilities. The other two are level abilities, one activated ability to advance the Class to level 2 and another to advance the Class to level 3.
2021/07/23: Each Class starts with only the first of three class abilities. As the first level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 2 and gains the second class ability. As the second level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 3 and gains the third class ability.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level won't remove abilities that a Class had at a previous level.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level is a normal activated ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
2021/07/23: You can't activate the first level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 1. Similarly, you can't activate the second level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 2.
2021/07/23: You can multiclass or even control multiple Class enchantments of the same class. Each Class permanent tracks its own level separately.
2021/07/23: Some Class cards have an effect that increases when more are under your control. For example, if you have multiple Barbarian Class cards, you roll that many additional dice and ignore that many of the lowest rolls.</Rulings>

<Artist>Andrew Mar</Artist>
<Multiverseid>527504</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: If you control multiple Bard Classes, legendary creatures you control enter the battlefield with that many additional +1/+1 counters.
2021/07/23: Unlike most abilities that reduce the costs of spells, Bard Class's Level 2 ability cannot be applied to generic mana costs. For example, a spell that costs {2}{G} to cast would instead cost {2} to cast.
2021/07/23: If you do not play the cards exiled with Bard Classes Level 3 ability on the turn they are exiled, they will remain exiled indefinitely and cannot be played on a later turn.
2021/07/23: If you exile a modal double-faced card this way, you may cast either face of that card.
2021/07/23: Each Class has five abilities. The three in the major sections of its text box are class abilities. Class abilities can be static, activated, or triggered abilities. The other two are level abilities, one activated ability to advance the Class to level 2 and another to advance the Class to level 3.
2021/07/23: Each Class starts with only the first of three class abilities. As the first level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 2 and gains the second class ability. As the second level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 3 and gains the third class ability.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level won't remove abilities that a Class had at a previous level.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level is a normal activated ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
2021/07/23: You can't activate the first level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 1. Similarly, you can't activate the second level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 2.
2021/07/23: You can multiclass or even control multiple Class enchantments of the same class. Each Class permanent tracks its own level separately.
2021/07/23: Some Class cards have an effect that increases when more are under your control. For example, if you have multiple Barbarian Class cards, you roll that many additional dice and ignore that many of the lowest rolls.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Barrowin of Clan Undurr's last ability works even if it wasn't on the battlefield when you completed a dungeon.
2021/07/23: To venture into the dungeon, a player moves their venture marker into the next room of the dungeon they are currently in. If they aren't currently in a dungeon, that player instead chooses a dungeon card from outside the game, puts it into the command zone, and moves their venture marker onto the first room.
2021/07/23: Moving into a dungeon room will cause its room ability to trigger.
2021/07/23: Once you resolve the last room ability of a dungeon, that dungeon is now completed and is removed from the game.
2021/07/23: A player may only have one dungeon in the command zone at a time.
2021/07/23: The player venturing into the dungeon chooses which dungeon they will venture into. They may choose a dungeon that they have already completed this game.
2021/07/23: Dungeon cards are not part of a player's deck or sideboard. In both constructed and limited formats, players can use any dungeon card when they venture into the dungeon.
2021/07/23: You can only move forward (well, downward) in a dungeon, never backwards or sideways.

<Rulings>2021/07/23: The discount to equip abilities applies only to generic mana requirements. If you control multiple Fighter Classes that are level 2 or higher, equip abilities cost {2} less for each one. This can't make an ability cost less than {0}.
2021/07/23: For the last triggered ability, if the target creature is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block, then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having that creature block, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to block in that case either.

2021/07/23: Copying a spell won't cause Sorcerer Class's level 3 ability to trigger and won't be counted toward the number of spells you've cast during the turn. However, if an effect copies a card and you cast the copy, that will count for both of those things.
2021/07/23: Each Class has five abilities. The three in the major sections of its text box are class abilities. Class abilities can be static, activated, or triggered abilities. The other two are level abilities, one activated ability to advance the Class to level 2 and another to advance the Class to level 3.
2021/07/23: Each Class starts with only the first of three class abilities. As the first level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 2 and gains the second class ability. As the second level ability resolves, the Class becomes level 3 and gains the third class ability.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level won't remove abilities that a Class had at a previous level.
2021/07/23: Gaining a level is a normal activated ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
2021/07/23: You can't activate the first level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 1. Similarly, you can't activate the second level ability of a Class unless that Class is level 2.
2021/07/23: You can multiclass or even control multiple Class enchantments of the same class. Each Class permanent tracks its own level separately.
2021/07/23: Some Class cards have an effect that increases when more are under your control. For example, if you have multiple Barbarian Class cards, you roll that many additional dice and ignore that many of the lowest rolls.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: If a creature's power is less than 0 when it's doubled, instead that creature gets -X/-0, where X is how much less than 0 its power is. For example, if an effect has given a 2/2 creature -4/-0 so that it's a -2/2 creature, doubling its power and toughness gives it -2/+2, and it becomes a -4/4 creature.</Rulings>

For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, a "whenever you gain life" ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.</Rulings>

2021/07/23: The target opponent may still cast spells in response to Xanathar, Guild Kingpin's ability in your upkeep. If that player has somehow become an illegal target for the ability as it tries to resolve, the ability does nothing. They may cast spells and you cannot look at or play the top card of their library.
2021/07/23: During your turn, you can look at the top card of the chosen opponent's library whenever you want (with one restriction; see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
2021/07/23: If the top card of that library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish doing so. This means that if you cast a spell from the top of that library, you can't look at the next card until you're done paying for that spell.

<Rulings>2021/07/23: Like all results tables, the one on The Deck of Many Things cares about the result of the die roll after any adjustments, such as subtracting the number of cards in your hand. This means it's usually not possible to get a result of 20 unless you have no cards in hand.
2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.
2021/07/23: Some abilities, like that of Pixie Guide and Barbarian Class, replace rolling a die with rolling extra dice and ignoring the lowest roll. The ignored rolls are not considered for the effect that instructed you to roll a die, and do not cause abilities to trigger. For all intents and purposes, once you determine which dice count, any extra dice were never rolled.
2021/07/23: Some effects instruct you to roll again. This uses the same number and type of dice as the original roll, and that roll will use the same set of possible outcomes.
2021/07/23: While playing Planechase, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result will ignore the rolling of the planar die.
2021/07/23: Tournament events have more specific rules regarding dice and die-rolling. For more information, please see the most recent version of the Magic Tournament Rules at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>527539</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: The "otherwise" in the last ability refers to whether or not you put it onto the battlefield, not whether or not it's an artifact card. You may put it into your hand even if it's an artifact card.
2021/07/23: If you choose to put the card into your hand, you don't need to reveal it.
2021/07/23: Dice are identified by the number of faces each one has. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die.
2021/07/23: Dice used must have equally likely outcomes and the roll must be fair. Although physical dice are recommended, digital substitutes are allowed, provided they have the same number of equally likely outcomes as specified in the original roll instruction.
2021/07/23: An ability that tells you to roll a die will also specify what to do with the result of that roll. Most often, this is in the form of a "results table" in the card text.
2021/07/23: The instruction to roll a die and the effect that occurs because of the result are all part of the same ability. Players do not get the chance to respond to the ability after knowing the result of the roll.
2021/07/23: An effect that says "choose a target, then roll a d20" or similar still uses the normal process of putting an ability on the stack and resolving it. Choosing targets is part of putting the ability on the stack and rolling the d20 happens later, as the ability resolves.
2021/07/23: Some effects may modify the result of a die roll. This may be part of the instruction to roll a die or it may come from other cards. Anything that references the "result" of a die roll is looking for the result after these modifications. Anything that is looking for the "natural result" is looking for the number shown on the face of the die before these modifications.

<Multiverseid>527542</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/07/23: To venture into the dungeon, a player moves their venture marker into the next room of the dungeon they are currently in. If they aren't currently in a dungeon, that player instead chooses a dungeon card from outside the game, puts it into the command zone, and moves their venture marker onto the first room.
2021/07/23: Moving into a dungeon room will cause its room ability to trigger.
2021/07/23: Once you resolve the last room ability of a dungeon, that dungeon is now completed and is removed from the game.
2021/07/23: A player may only have one dungeon in the command zone at a time.
2021/07/23: The player venturing into the dungeon chooses which dungeon they will venture into. They may choose a dungeon that they have already completed this game.
2021/07/23: Dungeon cards are not part of a player's deck or sideboard. In both constructed and limited formats, players can use any dungeon card when they venture into the dungeon.
2021/07/23: You can only move forward (well, downward) in a dungeon, never backwards or sideways.
2021/07/23: Dungeons are removed from the game as a state-based action.
2021/07/23: If you somehow venture into the dungeon while a room's ability is on the stack, you will continue on in the dungeon. If you're already in the last room, complete that dungeon and start a new one.
2021/07/23: Choosing the dungeon or room to venture into is part of resolving the venture into the dungeon keyword action. Once that choice is made, players may not respond until after the appropriate room ability has triggered.</Rulings>
