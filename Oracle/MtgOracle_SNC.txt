2022/04/29: Permanents phase back in during their controller's untap step, immediately before that player untaps their permanents. Creatures that phase in this way are able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn. If a permanent had counters on it when it phased out, it will have those counters when it phases back in.
2022/04/29: An attacking or blocking creature that phases out is removed from combat.

<Rulings>2022/04/29: If you choose to pay the blitz cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its blitz cost only if you could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.

<Rulings>2022/04/29: The game checks whether it is legal to cast a spell before costs are determined or mana abilities are activated while casting it. If cards are removed from your graveyard after that point, such as by exiling Jack-o'-Lantern from your graveyard to pay for its mana ability, this won't affect whether you can legally cast Graveyard Shift, even if that reduces the number of mana values in your graveyard to below five.
2022/04/29: If an effect allows you to cast Graveyard Shift from your graveyard, you may cast it any time you could cast an instant if you have five or more mana values among cards in your graveyard immediately before you begin to cast it, even if moving it to the stack would reduce that number to four.
2022/04/29: "Five or more mana values among cards in your graveyard" means there are at least five mana values among those cards.

<Rulings>2022/04/29: If you choose to pay the blitz cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered.

<Rulings>2022/04/29: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless it's copying a creature that's a token or that's copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether the creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Most notably, if the target creature isn't normally a creature, the copy won't be a creature.
2022/04/29: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2022/04/29: If a copied creature is copying something else, the token you create will use the copiable values of the target creature. In most cases, it will just be a copy of whatever that creature is copying.
2022/04/29: If a copied creature is a token that isn't a copy of something else, the copy copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
2022/04/29: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature card will also work.
2022/04/29: If another creature becomes a copy of, or enters the battlefield as a copy of, the token, that creature will copy the creature card the token is copying. However, it won't have either haste or "When this creature dies, draw a card," and you won't sacrifice the new copy at the beginning of the next end step.
2022/04/29: If Jaxis, the Troublemaker's ability creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (such as the one Doubling Season creates), you'll sacrifice each of them at the beginning of the next end step.
2022/04/29: If you choose to pay the blitz cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its blitz cost only if you could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2022/04/29: If you pay the blitz cost to cast a creature spell, that permanent will be sacrificed only if it's still on the battlefield when that triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.

<Rulings>2022/04/29: If you choose to pay the blitz cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its blitz cost only if you could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2022/04/29: If you pay the blitz cost to cast a creature spell, that permanent will be sacrificed only if it's still on the battlefield when that triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2022/04/29: You don't have to attack with the creature with blitz unless another ability says you do.
2022/04/29: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose blitz cost was paid, the copy won't have haste, won't be sacrificed, and its controller won't draw a card when it dies.
2022/04/29: The triggered ability that lets its controller draw a card triggers when it dies for any reason, not just when you sacrifice it during the end step.</Rulings>

2022/04/29: Removing a shield counter in this way isn't the same as regenerating a creature.

2022/04/29: A creature with a shield counter on it may still be destroyed by state-based actions if it has damage marked on it equal to its toughness or has been dealt unpreventable damage by a source with deathtouch.

<Rulings>2022/04/29: Once an ability that causes a creature to connive begins to resolve, no player may take any other actions until it's done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the conniving creature after you discard a nonland card but before it receives a counter.
2022/04/29: If no card is discarded, most likely because that player's hand is empty and an effect says they can't draw cards, the conniving creature does not receive a +1/+1 counter.
2022/04/29: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to connive but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still connives. If you discard a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything. Abilities that trigger "when [that creature] connives" will trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2022/04/29: "If you don't" in the second ability refers to whether you played a land or cast a spell from the top of your library, not just whether or not you cast a spell.
2022/04/29: If you choose to pay the blitz cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its blitz cost only if you could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2022/04/29: If you pay the blitz cost to cast a creature spell, that permanent will be sacrificed only if it's still on the battlefield when that triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2022/04/29: You don't have to attack with the creature with blitz unless another ability says you do.
2022/04/29: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose blitz cost was paid, the copy won't have haste, won't be sacrificed, and its controller won't draw a card when it dies.
2022/04/29: The triggered ability that lets its controller draw a card triggers when it dies for any reason, not just when you sacrifice it during the end step.</Rulings>
