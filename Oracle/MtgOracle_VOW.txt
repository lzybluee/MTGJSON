2021/11/19: If you cast a spell for its cleave cost, that spell doesn't have any of the text in square brackets while it's on the stack.
2021/11/19: A cleave cost is an alternative cost that's paid instead of the spell's mana cost. Casting a spell for its cleave cost doesn't change the spell's mana value.
2021/11/19: You can't cast a spell for both its cleave cost and another alternative cost. For example, if an effect gives an Alchemist's Retrieval in your graveyard a flashback cost of {U}, you can't cast it from your graveyard for its cleave cost.
2021/11/19: If an effect allows you to "cast a spell without paying its mana cost," you can't cast that spell for its cleave cost.</Rulings>

2021/11/19: In some unusual cases, you may end up putting the appropriate counters on more than one permanent. For example, if you control The Ozolith when Parish-Blade Trainee dies, you'll put the appropriate number of each kind of counter onto both The Ozolith and the target creature.
2021/11/19: If Parish-Blade Trainee has -1/-1 counters on it when it dies, the last ability will include those as well. This may result in the recipient also dying.

<Rulings>2021/11/19: Welcoming Vampire's ability checks the power of the other creatures only as they enter the battlefield. If one of those creatures has power 2 or less, the ability will trigger. Once the ability triggers, raising that creature's power above 2 won't affect that ability. Similarly, reducing a creature's power to 2 or less after it enters the battlefield won't cause the ability to trigger.
2021/11/19: If creatures enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters or a continuous effect such as that of Wedding Festivity will apply to the creatures on the battlefield, those effects apply when checking to see if Welcoming Vampire's ability will trigger.</Rulings>

However, if Null Profusion entered the battlefield after Inspired Idea resolved, your maximum hand size would be two.

<Rulings>2021/11/19: If you cast a spell for its cleave cost, that spell doesn't have any of the text in square brackets while it's on the stack.
2021/11/19: A cleave cost is an alternative cost that's paid instead of the spell's mana cost. Casting a spell for its cleave cost doesn't change the spell's mana value.
2021/11/19: You can't cast a spell for both its cleave cost and another alternative cost. For example, if an effect gives an Alchemist's Retrieval in your graveyard a flashback cost of {U}, you can't cast it from your graveyard for its cleave cost.
2021/11/19: If an effect allows you to "cast a spell without paying its mana cost," you can't cast that spell for its cleave cost.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>540914</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/11/19: Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as equip and crew, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
2021/11/19: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as prowess and fabricate, are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
2021/11/19: If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggers at the beginning of the "next" occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won't trigger again the following time that phase or step occurs.
2021/11/19: Overcharged Amalgam's exploit ability can't target mana abilities. An activated mana ability is one that could add mana to a player's mana pool as it resolves, doesn't have a target, and isn't a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool and triggers based on an activated mana ability.
2021/11/19: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can't be targeted. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and can't be targeted.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/11/19: In the phrase "as long as an Equipment named . . . is attached to a creature you control," the "you" is the controller of the Equipment, not the controller of the creature it's attached to. Suppose an opponent controls a creature equipped with Bride's Gown and another creature equipped with Groom's Finery, and they also control both of those Equipment. If you gain control of one of those creatures but not the Equipment attached to it, the creature you gained control of will get all the bonuses and the creature they control will only get +2/+0.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2021/11/19: If multiple "extra turn" effects resolve in the same turn, the most recently created turn will be taken first.
2021/11/19: If you somehow skip the extra turn Alchemist's Gambit gives you or skip that turn's end step, the delayed triggered ability never triggers. (If you cast Alchemist's Gambit by paying its cleave cost, the delayed triggered ability is never created at all.)
2021/11/19: Exiling Alchemist's Gambit happens as part of its resolution. If the spell is countered, it will go to the graveyard as normal.
2021/11/19: If you cast a spell for its cleave cost, that spell doesn't have any of the text in square brackets while it's on the stack.
2021/11/19: A cleave cost is an alternative cost that's paid instead of the spell's mana cost. Casting a spell for its cleave cost doesn't change the spell's mana value.
2021/11/19: You can't cast a spell for both its cleave cost and another alternative cost. For example, if an effect gives an Alchemist's Retrieval in your graveyard a flashback cost of {U}, you can't cast it from your graveyard for its cleave cost.
2021/11/19: If an effect allows you to "cast a spell without paying its mana cost," you can't cast that spell for its cleave cost.</Rulings>

[+1]: Exile the top card of your library. If it's red, you may cast it this turn.

<Artist>Viktor Titov</Artist>
<Multiverseid>541004</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/11/19: Chandra's first ability uses the stack and can be responded to, even if no targets were chosen. It doesn't count as a mana ability.
2021/11/19: Chandra's second ability checks the characteristics of the card you exiled to see if it's red. If the spell that card becomes somehow isn't red, you may still cast it. For example, Rowan, Scholar of Sparks, the front face of a modal double-faced card, is red. Will, Scholar of Frost, the back face of the same card, is blue. In exile, that card is red, so you may cast either face if you exile it with this ability.
2021/11/19: Chandra's last ability, by contrast, only allows you to cast spells that are red when you cast them, no matter what the card in exile is. If Rowan, Scholar of Sparks is exiled by this ability, you won't be able to cast Will, Scholar of Frost this way because it would be a blue spell.
2021/11/19: You must pay all costs for spells cast via Chandra's last two abilities. For the middle ability, you must also follow all timing restrictions.
2021/11/19: The emblem's triggered ability looks for the actual amount of mana spent to cast the spell. If an effect caused you to pay more or less mana for that spell as you cast it, that will be taken into account when determining the value of X. If an effect would counter that spell unless you pay some amount of mana, that mana doesn't count as mana spent to cast it.</Rulings>

Whenever Cemetery Prowler enters the battlefield or attacks, exile a card from a graveyard.
Spells you cast cost {1} less to cast for each card type they share with cards exiled with Cemetery Prowler.</CardText>
<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Multiverseid>541053</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2021/11/19: Card types that can be exiled from a graveyard include artifact, creature, enchantment, land, planeswalker, instant, and sorcery. Legendary, basic, and snow are supertypes, not card types. Human, Equipment, and Aura are subtypes, not card types.
2021/11/19: Cemetery Prowler's last ability checks the number of card types among cards exiled with it, not the number of cards exiled. For example, if Cemetery Prowler has exiled two creature cards, creature spells you cast cost {1} less, not {2} less.</Rulings>

2021/11/19: A cleave cost is an alternative cost that's paid instead of the spell's mana cost. Casting a spell for its cleave cost doesn't change the spell's mana value.
2021/11/19: You can't cast a spell for both its cleave cost and another alternative cost. For example, if an effect gives an Alchemist's Retrieval in your graveyard a flashback cost of {U}, you can't cast it from your graveyard for its cleave cost.
