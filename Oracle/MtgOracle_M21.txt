2020/06/23: Players can cast spells and activate abilities after the second triggered ability resolves but before the spell that caused it to trigger does.
2020/06/23: Once Ghostly Pilferer has been blocked, activating its last ability doesn't cause it to become unblocked.</Rulings>

<Artist>Lindsey Look</Artist>
<Multiverseid>485397</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/06/23: You can't choose any one mode more than once.
2020/06/23: If any of the targets become illegal, the remaining targets are affected as appropriate.
2020/06/23: If you choose more than one mode, you perform the modes in the order specified. For example, if you choose to counter target spell, return target nonland permanent to its owner's hand, and have target player draw a card, that permanent will be on the battlefield while that spell is countered (and may modify, affect, or trigger on that event) but will not be on the battlefield while that player draws a card.
2020/06/23: Sublime Epiphany's second mode counters only activated and triggered abilities already on the stack. It doesn't prevent abilities from being activated or from triggering later in the turn, and it has no effect on static abilities.
2020/06/23: Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
2020/06/23: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as prowess) are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
2020/06/23: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can't be countered. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and can't be countered.
2020/06/23: Sublime Epiphany's second mode can't counter an activated or triggered mana ability. An activated mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool as it resolves, doesn't have a target, and isn't a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool and triggers on an activated mana ability.
2020/06/23: If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggered at the beginning of the "next" occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won't trigger again the following time that phase or step occurs.
2020/06/23: If you choose the third and fourth modes and target the same creature you control both times, you'll return it and then create a token that's a copy of it, using its copiable values as it last appeared on the battlefield. This is because the legality of targets is checked only as the spell begins to resolve, before any actions are performed.
2020/06/23: The token copies exactly what is printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature is a token or is copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2020/06/23: If the copied creature is itself a token, the token created by Sublime Epiphany copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
2020/06/23: If the copied creature is copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature is copying.
2020/06/23: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2020/06/23: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.</Rulings>

2020/06/23: An attacking creature that phases out is removed from combat.
2020/06/23: Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
2020/06/23: Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Kitesail Freebooter, won't happen when a permanent phases out.
2020/06/23: Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration such as that of Awakener Druid ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.
2020/06/23: Each Aura and Equipment attached to a permanent that's phasing out also phases out. They will phase in with that permanent and still be attached to it. Similarly, permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.
2020/06/23: Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
2020/06/23: If an opponent gains control of your creature and it phases out and the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases in, that permanent phases in under your control as that opponent's next untap step begins. If they leave the game before their next untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after their turn would have begun.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/06/23: If a spell or ability causes you to put a card into your hand without specifically using the word "draw," it's not a card drawn.
2020/06/23: If two or more replacement effects would apply to a card-drawing event, the player drawing the card chooses the order in which to apply them.
2020/06/23: Because Teferi's Ageless Insight is legendary, it's unlikely that one player will control two. However, if that happens, each card that player would draw after the first will result in four cards being drawn. If they control three, they draw eight cards, and so on.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/06/23: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to creatures may become lethal if Kaervek enters the battlefield during that turn.
2020/06/23: If you control more than one Kaervek, each will give each other creature -1/-1. If these effects cause a creature's toughness to become less than or equal to 0 or the amount of damage marked on it, those creatures die at the same time that the "legend rule" remove your excess Kaerveks.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/06/23: As Liliana's first ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is chooses a card in hand without revealing it, then each other player in turn order does the same. Then all the chosen cards are discarded at the same time. Finally, each opponent who couldn't discard a card loses 3 life.
2020/06/23: A player who has a card in hand can't choose to lose 3 life instead of discarding a card.
2020/06/23: If you have no cards in hand, you just don't discard anything. You don't lose 3 life. Other players still discard if able.
2020/06/23: The value of X is determined only as Liliana's second ability resolves. Once that happens, the value of X won't change later in the turn even if the number of cards in your graveyard changes.

<Rulings>2020/06/23: Because Vito's first ability doesn't deal damage, you won't gain life when it resolves if Vito has lifelink.

2020/06/23: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Vito's first ability will trigger twice and you may choose a different opponent for each trigger. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2020/06/23: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and Vito's first ability triggers only once.
2020/06/23: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/06/23: A creature can be dealt an amount of damage greater than its toughness. For example, if Brash Taunter is dealt 3 damage, its middle ability deals 3 damage, not 1, to the target opponent.
2020/06/23: If your life total is brought to 0 or less at the same time that Brash Taunter is dealt damage, you lose the game before its middle ability goes on the stack.
2020/06/23: If the target creature is an illegal target when Brash Taunter's last ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. If Brash Taunter is no longer on the battlefield, the target creature won't deal or be dealt damage.</Rulings>

2020/06/23: The cost reduction applies only to generic mana in the cost of Chandra's Incinerator. It can't reduce the {R} requirement.

2020/06/23: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text.
2020/06/23: If an activated ability of Goblin card on top of your library references the card it's printed on by name, treat Conspicuous Snoop's instance of that ability as though it referenced Conspicuous Snoop by name instead. For instance, if Conspicuous Snoop has Brash Taunter's ability, Conspicuous Snoop fights, not Brash Taunter.
2020/06/23: If Conspicuous Snoop gains a set of linked activated abilities (for example, one ability that exiles a card and another that refers to the card "exiled with" the object), that link only lasts as long as Conspicuous Snoop has those abilities.

<Multiverseid>485495</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/06/23: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Volcanic Salvo). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2020/06/23: The cost reduction applies only to generic mana in the cost of Volcanic Salvo. It can't reduce the {R}{R} requirement.
2020/06/23: Once you begin to cast Volcanic Salvo, players can't take other actions until you've finished casting it. Notably, they can't try to change the total power of your creatures.
2020/06/23: The total cost to cast Volcanic Salvo is locked in before you pay that cost. For example, if you control three 2/2 creatures, including one you can sacrifice to add {C} to your mana pool, the total cost is {4}{R}{R}. Then you can sacrifice the creature when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost.
2020/06/23: If a creature's power is somehow less than 0, it subtracts from the total power of your other creatures. If the total power of your creatures is 0 or less, the cost remains {10}{R}{R}.
2020/06/23: You can't target the same creature or planeswalker twice with Volcanic Salvo to deal 12 damage to it.</Rulings>

2020/06/23: Sporeweb Weaver's last ability triggers even if the damage causes it to die.

<CardText>[+1]: Draw a card.
[-3]: Put target creature on top of its owner's library.
[-8]: Each creature target opponent controls phases out. Until the end of your next turn, they can't phase in. (Treat them and anything attached to them as though they don't exist.)</CardText>
<Artist>Jake Murray</Artist>
<Multiverseid>488630</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/06/23: Normally, phased-out permanents phase in during their controller's untap step. Teferi's last ability causes the phased-out permanents to not phase in until the duration has expired; they'll phase in during their controller's next untap step after your next turn.
2020/06/23: While a permanent is phased out, it's treated as though it doesn't exist. It can't be the target of spells or abilities, its static abilities have no effect on the game, its triggered abilities can't trigger, it can't attack or block, and so on.
2020/06/23: An attacking creature that phases out is removed from combat.
2020/06/23: Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
2020/06/23: Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Kitesail Freebooter, won't happen when a permanent phases out.
2020/06/23: Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration such as that of Awakener Druid ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.
2020/06/23: Each Aura and Equipment attached to a permanent that's phasing out also phases out. They will phase in with that permanent and still be attached to it. Similarly, permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.
2020/06/23: Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
2020/06/23: Any creatures that phase in during their controller's untap step will be able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn.
2020/06/23: If an opponent gains control of your creature and it phases out and the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases in, that permanent phases in under your control as that opponent's appropriate untap step begins. If they leave the game before that untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after that turn would have begun.
2020/06/23: In a multiplayer game, if you leave the game after Teferi's last ability resolves but before your next turn ends, its effect lasts until your next turn would have begun. It neither expires immediately nor lasts indefinitely.</Rulings>
