<Artist>Tyler Jacobson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476256</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/01/24: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2020/01/24: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2020/01/24: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2020/01/24: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2020/01/24: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters.
2020/01/24: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

2020/01/24: Heliod's triggered ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Daxos, Blessed by the Sun or 3 life from Cling to Dust. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and Heliod's ability triggers only once.
2020/01/24: If a creature is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it can't receive a counter from Heliod's ability in time to save it.
2020/01/24: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Heliod's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2020/01/24: Heliod can be the target of its own triggered ability.
2020/01/24: A noncreature enchantment with a +1/+1 counter on it will be unaffected by that counter until it becomes a creature, at which time it will get +1/+1 for that counter.
2020/01/24: Multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature are redundant.
2020/01/24: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.
2020/01/24: Colorless and generic mana symbols ({C}, {0}, {1}, {2}, {X}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2020/01/24: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2020/01/24: If you put an Aura on an opponent's permanent, you still control the Aura, and mana symbols in its mana cost count towards your devotion.
2020/01/24: The type-changing ability that can make a God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color. It's always a creature spell while it's on the stack.
2020/01/24: As a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color will determine whether any replacement effects that affect creatures entering the battlefield apply to that God. Because replacement effects are considered before the God is on the battlefield, the mana symbols in its mana cost won't be counted when determining this.
2020/01/24: When a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: Escape's permission doesn't change when you may cast the spell from your graveyard.
2020/01/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an escape cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.
2020/01/24: After an escaped spell resolves, it returns to its owner's graveyard if it's not a permanent spell. If it is a permanent spell, it enters the battlefield and will return to its owner's graveyard if it dies later. Perhaps it will escape again—good underworld security is so hard to come by these days.
2020/01/24: If a card has multiple abilities giving you permission to cast it, such as two escape abilities or an escape ability and a flashback ability, you choose which one to apply. The others have no effect.
2020/01/24: If you cast a spell with its escape permission, you can't choose to apply any other alternative costs or to cast it without paying its mana cost. If it has any additional costs, you must pay those.
2020/01/24: If a card with escape is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.

When Ashiok's Erasure enters the battlefield, exile target spell.
Your opponents can't cast spells with the same name as the exiled card.
When Ashiok's Erasure leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to its owner's hand.</CardText>
<Artist>Zezhou Chen</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476294</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/01/24: The exiled spell isn't countered, but it won't resolve. This works against spells that can't be countered.
2020/01/24: If Ashiok's Erasure leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability has resolved, its last ability triggers and resolves with no effect, then its enters-the-battlefield ability exiles the target spell for the rest of the game.
2020/01/24: If there is no exiled card (perhaps because the exiled spell was a copy of a spell or was a commander spell that moved to the command zone in the Commander variant), or if the exiled card leaves exile somehow, Ashiok's Erasure won't stop players from casting spells.
2020/01/24: If Ashiok's Erasure has exiled a split card, your opponents can't cast a spell with the same name as either half of that card.
2020/01/24: If Ashiok's Erasure has exiled an adventurer card, your opponents can't cast spells with the same name as the creature, but may cast their Adventures.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Brine Giant). The mana value of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2020/01/24: The cost reduction ability reduces only the generic mana in Brine Giant's cost. The colored mana must still be paid.
2020/01/24: Once you announce that you're casting a spell, no player may take actions until the spell has been paid for. Notably, opponents can't try to change by how much Brine Giant's cost is reduced.</Rulings>

2020/01/24: An opponent's spell that targets a single creature or enchantment you control more than once costs only {1} more to cast. An opponent's spell that targets multiple creatures and/or enchantments you control costs {1} more for each of them.
2020/01/24: Colorless and generic mana symbols ({C}, {0}, {1}, {2}, {X}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2020/01/24: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2020/01/24: If you put an Aura on an opponent's permanent, you still control the Aura, and mana symbols in its mana cost count towards your devotion.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: Escape's permission doesn't change when you may cast the spell from your graveyard.
2020/01/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an escape cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.
2020/01/24: After an escaped spell resolves, it returns to its owner's graveyard if it's not a permanent spell. If it is a permanent spell, it enters the battlefield and will return to its owner's graveyard if it dies later. Perhaps it will escape again—good underworld security is so hard to come by these days.
2020/01/24: If a card has multiple abilities giving you permission to cast it, such as two escape abilities or an escape ability and a flashback ability, you choose which one to apply. The others have no effect.
2020/01/24: If you cast a spell with its escape permission, you can't choose to apply any other alternative costs or to cast it without paying its mana cost. If it has any additional costs, you must pay those.
2020/01/24: If a card with escape is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.
2020/01/24: Once you begin casting a spell with escape, it immediately moves to the stack. Players can't take any other actions until you're done casting the spell.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>476302</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/01/24: Ichthyomorphosis may enchant a permanent that is only temporarily a creature, such as a Vehicle. If this happens, Ichthyomorphosis will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action once the creature stops being a creature.
2020/01/24: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a creature may become lethal if Ichthyomorphosis becomes attached to it during that turn.
2020/01/24: If the affected creature gains an ability after Ichthyomorphosis becomes attached to it, it will keep that ability.
2020/01/24: Ichthyomorphosis overwrites all colors and creature types the enchanted creature has. It's just a blue Fish. The creature keeps any supertypes (such as legendary) it has, as well as any other card types it has (such as enchantment).
2020/01/24: Ichthyomorphosis overwrites all previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Ichthyomorphosis becomes attached to a creature will overwrite this effect.
2020/01/24: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: Nonland permanents target opponent controls that are already tapped when the second chapter ability resolves won't be tapped again, but they won't untap during their controller's next untap step.
2020/01/24: The second chapter ability keeps the permanents tapped even if Kiora Bests the Sea God leaves the battlefield before that player's next untap step.
2020/01/24: Any nonland permanents that come under the target player's control after the second chapter ability resolves will untap as normal.
2020/01/24: The second chapter ability targets the player but not their permanents. Permanents with hexproof may be tapped this way.
2020/01/24: The control-change effect of the third chapter ability lasts indefinitely. It doesn't wear off during the cleanup step. In a multiplayer game, it does expire if you leave the game.
2020/01/24: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2020/01/24: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2020/01/24: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2020/01/24: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2020/01/24: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters.
2020/01/24: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

2020/01/24: Escape's permission doesn't change when you may cast the spell from your graveyard.

The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.

<Rulings>2020/01/24: When the card returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the card that was exiled. Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2020/01/24: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If you gain control of a creature "until end of turn," you'll control it during your end step.
2020/01/24: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2020/01/24: When an effect returns the exiled card "under your control," you control it indefinitely after that. In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any creatures you control from Thassa's effect but don't own are exiled.
2020/01/24: Colorless and generic mana symbols ({C}, {0}, {1}, {2}, {X}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2020/01/24: If you put an Aura on an opponent's permanent, you still control the Aura, and mana symbols in its mana cost count towards your devotion.
2020/01/24: The type-changing ability that can make a God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color. It's always a creature spell while it's on the stack.
2020/01/24: As a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color will determine whether any replacement effects that affect creatures entering the battlefield apply to that God. Because replacement effects are considered before the God is on the battlefield, the mana symbols in its mana cost won't be counted when determining this.
2020/01/24: When a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and the creature type God. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2020/01/24: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2020/01/24: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat. It won't rejoin combat if it resumes being a creature later during that combat.
2020/01/24: Counters put on a God remain on it while it's not a creature, even if they have no effect.
2020/01/24: If an effect causes a God to lose all abilities, its ability that causes it to stop being a creature still applies if appropriate.</Rulings>

2020/01/24: Escape's permission doesn't change when you may cast the spell from your graveyard.
2020/01/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an escape cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.

If it is a permanent spell, it enters the battlefield and will return to its owner's graveyard if it dies later. Perhaps it will escape again—good underworld security is so hard to come by these days.
2020/01/24: If a card has multiple abilities giving you permission to cast it, such as two escape abilities or an escape ability and a flashback ability, you choose which one to apply. The others have no effect.

2020/01/24: The cost reduction ability reduces only the generic mana in Drag to the Underworld's cost. The colored mana must still be paid.

<Multiverseid>476342</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/01/24: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2020/01/24: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2020/01/24: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2020/01/24: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2020/01/24: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters.
2020/01/24: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

2020/01/24: As a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color will determine whether any replacement effects that affect creatures entering the battlefield apply to that God.

2020/01/24: When a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.

<Rulings>2020/01/24: Because Inevitable End grants the ability to the enchanted creature, the triggered ability triggers at the beginning of the upkeep of the controller of the enchanted creature, and that player chooses a creature to sacrifice. They might not sacrifice the enchanted creature right away, but it's certain that they'll have to do so eventually.
2020/01/24: Players may take actions before the triggered ability granted by Inevitable End resolves, but they can't take any actions during a turn before that turn's upkeep begins to try to stop the ability from triggering.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: Escape's permission doesn't change when you may cast the spell from your graveyard.
2020/01/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an escape cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.
2020/01/24: After an escaped spell resolves, it returns to its owner's graveyard if it's not a permanent spell. If it is a permanent spell, it enters the battlefield and will return to its owner's graveyard if it dies later. Perhaps it will escape again—good underworld security is so hard to come by these days.
2020/01/24: If a card has multiple abilities giving you permission to cast it, such as two escape abilities or an escape ability and a flashback ability, you choose which one to apply. The others have no effect.
2020/01/24: If you cast a spell with its escape permission, you can't choose to apply any other alternative costs or to cast it without paying its mana cost. If it has any additional costs, you must pay those.
2020/01/24: If a card with escape is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.

<Artist>Tyler Jacobson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476359</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/01/24: The token copies the creature as it last existed on the battlefield before it died, not as it existed in the graveyard before it was exiled.
2020/01/24: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that had changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2020/01/24: If the copied creature was copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2020/01/24: If the copied creature had {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2020/01/24: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the creature will also work.
2020/01/24: If the token is a copy of a creature whose power and toughness are defined by an ability (usually printed as */* or similar), the token doesn't copy the ability that defines its power and toughness. It remains a 1/1 creature.
2020/01/24: If something becomes a copy of the token, the copy is also a 1/1 and a Nightmare.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: The card that you exile for the first two chapter abilities may be one of the cards that you just put into your graveyard.
2020/01/24: While resolving the first two chapter abilities, you can't exile multiple cards to create multiple Zombies.
2020/01/24: If X is greater than the number of cards in your library while resolving the third chapter ability, you look at your entire library and put it back in any order. You still gain life equal to the full value of X.
2020/01/24: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2020/01/24: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2020/01/24: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2020/01/24: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2020/01/24: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters.
2020/01/24: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

The mana value of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.
2020/01/24: After an escaped spell resolves, it returns to its owner's graveyard if it's not a permanent spell. If it is a permanent spell, it enters the battlefield and will return to its owner's graveyard if it dies later. Perhaps it will escape again—good underworld security is so hard to come by these days.
2020/01/24: If a card has multiple abilities giving you permission to cast it, such as two escape abilities or an escape ability and a flashback ability, you choose which one to apply. The others have no effect.
2020/01/24: If you cast a spell with its escape permission, you can't choose to apply any other alternative costs or to cast it without paying its mana cost. If it has any additional costs, you must pay those.
2020/01/24: If a card with escape is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.
2020/01/24: Once you begin casting a spell with escape, it immediately moves to the stack. Players can't take any other actions until you're done casting the spell.</Rulings>

<CardText>(As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
I — Gain control of target creature for as long as The Akroan War remains on the battlefield.
II — Until your next turn, creatures your opponents control attack each combat if able.
III — Each tapped creature deals damage to itself equal to its power.</CardText>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476375</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/01/24: If The Akroan War leaves the battlefield before its first ability resolves, you won't gain control of the creature at all.
2020/01/24: If a creature can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2020/01/24: Because a Saga isn't sacrificed until after its last ability has resolved, you still control the creature you took with The Akroan War's first ability while the last ability is resolving.
2020/01/24: If the creature you took with The Akroan War's first ability has an ability that triggers when you sacrifice The Akroan War, you control the resulting trigger. If it has an ability that triggers when The Akroan War is put into a graveyard "from anywhere," check whether that ability should trigger only after the creature's former controller has regained control of it.
2020/01/24: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2020/01/24: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2020/01/24: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2020/01/24: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2020/01/24: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters.
2020/01/24: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

2020/01/24: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2020/01/24: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2020/01/24: If you put an Aura on an opponent's permanent, you still control the Aura, and mana symbols in its mana cost count towards your devotion.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: If you put an Aura on an opponent's permanent, you still control the Aura, and mana symbols in its mana cost count towards your devotion.

2020/01/24: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2020/01/24: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2020/01/24: The type-changing ability that can make a God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color. It's always a creature spell while it's on the stack.
2020/01/24: As a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color will determine whether any replacement effects that affect creatures entering the battlefield apply to that God. Because replacement effects are considered before the God is on the battlefield, the mana symbols in its mana cost won't be counted when determining this.
2020/01/24: When a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and the creature type God. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2020/01/24: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2020/01/24: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat. It won't rejoin combat if it resumes being a creature later during that combat.
2020/01/24: Counters put on a God remain on it while it's not a creature, even if they have no effect.
2020/01/24: If an effect causes a God to lose all abilities, its ability that causes it to stop being a creature still applies if appropriate.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: The value of X for the first three chapters is determined only as each chapter ability resolves. Once that happens, the value of X won't change later in the turn even if the number of lore counters on The Triumph of Anax changes.
2020/01/24: If either target is an illegal target as the final chapter ability resolves, no creature will deal or be dealt damage.
2020/01/24: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2020/01/24: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2020/01/24: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2020/01/24: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2020/01/24: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters.
2020/01/24: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: If a card with escape is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.
2020/01/24: Once you begin casting a spell with escape, it immediately moves to the stack. Players can't take any other actions until you're done casting the spell.
2020/01/24: If a card has no mana cost, its escape cost is an unpayable cost, so you can't cast it for that cost.
2020/01/24: If you're casting an adventurer card or split card with escape, you choose how you wish to cast it, then pay the appropriate cost (for the Adventure, the creature, or the half of the split card you chose) plus exiling three cards.
2020/01/24: If a spell you're casting with escape has an additional cost of discarding cards or sacrificing permanents, you may exile cards discarded or sacrificed this way to pay that part of its escape cost.
2020/01/24: Escape's permission doesn't change when you may cast the spell from your graveyard.
2020/01/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an escape cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.
2020/01/24: After an escaped spell resolves, it returns to its owner's graveyard if it's not a permanent spell. If it is a permanent spell, it enters the battlefield and will return to its owner's graveyard if it dies later. Perhaps it will escape again—good underworld security is so hard to come by these days.
2020/01/24: If a card has multiple abilities giving you permission to cast it, such as two escape abilities or an escape ability and a flashback ability, you choose which one to apply. The others have no effect.
2020/01/24: If you cast a spell with its escape permission, you can't choose to apply any other alternative costs or to cast it without paying its mana cost. If it has any additional costs, you must pay those.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2020/01/24: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2020/01/24: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2020/01/24: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2020/01/24: Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger. If lore counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters.
2020/01/24: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities, the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.

2020/01/24: The type-changing ability that can make a God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color. It's always a creature spell while it's on the stack.
2020/01/24: As a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color will determine whether any replacement effects that affect creatures entering the battlefield apply to that God. Because replacement effects are considered before the God is on the battlefield, the mana symbols in its mana cost won't be counted when determining this.
2020/01/24: When a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and the creature type God. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2020/01/24: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2020/01/24: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat. It won't rejoin combat if it resumes being a creature later during that combat.
2020/01/24: Counters put on a God remain on it while it's not a creature, even if they have no effect.

<Rulings>2020/01/24: Escape's permission doesn't change when you may cast the spell from your graveyard.
2020/01/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an escape cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.
2020/01/24: After an escaped spell resolves, it returns to its owner's graveyard if it's not a permanent spell. If it is a permanent spell, it enters the battlefield and will return to its owner's graveyard if it dies later. Perhaps it will escape again—good underworld security is so hard to come by these days.
2020/01/24: If a card has multiple abilities giving you permission to cast it, such as two escape abilities or an escape ability and a flashback ability, you choose which one to apply. The others have no effect.
2020/01/24: If you cast a spell with its escape permission, you can't choose to apply any other alternative costs or to cast it without paying its mana cost. If it has any additional costs, you must pay those.
2020/01/24: If a card with escape is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.
2020/01/24: Once you begin casting a spell with escape, it immediately moves to the stack. Players can't take any other actions until you're done casting the spell.</Rulings>

2020/01/24: If you exile a nonland card, you gain only 2 life, no matter how many opponents are dealt damage.
2020/01/24: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Klothys's last ability causes the opposing team to lose 4 life and you gain 2 life.
2020/01/24: Colorless and generic mana symbols ({C}, {0}, {1}, {2}, {X}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2020/01/24: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2020/01/24: If you put an Aura on an opponent's permanent, you still control the Aura, and mana symbols in its mana cost count towards your devotion.
2020/01/24: Your devotion to two colors is the number of mana symbols among mana costs of permanents you control that are the first color, the second, or both. If an effect counts your devotion to two colors, a hybrid symbol that is both of those colors is counted just once.
2020/01/24: The type-changing ability that can make a God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color. It's always a creature spell while it's on the stack.
2020/01/24: As a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color will determine whether any replacement effects that affect creatures entering the battlefield apply to that God. Because replacement effects are considered before the God is on the battlefield, the mana symbols in its mana cost won't be counted when determining this.
2020/01/24: When a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and the creature type God. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2020/01/24: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2020/01/24: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat. It won't rejoin combat if it resumes being a creature later during that combat.
2020/01/24: Counters put on a God remain on it while it's not a creature, even if they have no effect.
2020/01/24: If an effect causes a God to lose all abilities, its ability that causes it to stop being a creature still applies if appropriate.</Rulings>

Whenever Kroxa enters the battlefield or attacks, each opponent discards a card, then each opponent who didn't discard a nonland card this way loses 3 life.

<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Multiverseid>476472</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2020/01/24: Kroxa's first ability causes you to sacrifice it if you didn't cast it, or if it was cast using any permission other than an escape ability.
2020/01/24: Kroxa's second ability triggers when it enters the battlefield, even if it didn't escape.
2020/01/24: As the second ability resolves, first the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's an opponent's turn, the opponent whose turn it is) chooses a card in hand without revealing it, then each other opponent in turn order does the same. All the chosen cards are discarded at the same time, and then the appropriate players lose 3 life each.
2020/01/24: An opponent loses 3 life if they discard a land card or if they can't discard a card at all.
2020/01/24: Escape's permission doesn't change when you may cast the spell from your graveyard.
2020/01/24: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an escape cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was and no matter whether an alternative cost was paid.
2020/01/24: After an escaped spell resolves, it returns to its owner's graveyard if it's not a permanent spell. If it is a permanent spell, it enters the battlefield and will return to its owner's graveyard if it dies later. Perhaps it will escape again—good underworld security is so hard to come by these days.
2020/01/24: If a card has multiple abilities giving you permission to cast it, such as two escape abilities or an escape ability and a flashback ability, you choose which one to apply. The others have no effect.
2020/01/24: If you cast a spell with its escape permission, you can't choose to apply any other alternative costs or to cast it without paying its mana cost. If it has any additional costs, you must pay those.
2020/01/24: If a card with escape is put into your graveyard during your turn, you'll be able to cast it right away if it's legal to do so, before an opponent can take any actions.
2020/01/24: Once you begin casting a spell with escape, it immediately moves to the stack. Players can't take any other actions until you're done casting the spell.</Rulings>

2020/01/24: Look at the card as it exists in your graveyard to determine whether it can enter the battlefield. For example, Sculpting Steel (a noncreature card in the graveyard) can be put onto the battlefield as a copy of a creature, but Phyrexian Metamorph (a creature card in the graveyard) can't be put onto the battlefield, even if it would copy a noncreature artifact.

The same is true if an opponent's permanent gains indestructible or hexproof after Shadowspear's second ability resolves.
2020/01/24: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, damage previously dealt to a creature with indestructible may cause it to be destroyed if Shadowspear's second ability resolves during that turn.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2020/01/24: If a token with a coin counter on it dies or is exiled, Athreos's last ability triggers, but won't return it to the battlefield.
2020/01/24: The creature returns to the battlefield without a coin counter on it.
2020/01/24: If an effect exiles a creature with a coin counter on it and immediately returns it to the battlefield, Athreos's last ability triggers but will have no effect. If an effect exiles a creature with a coin counter on it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, Athreos's last ability will return that card to the battlefield and it won't be returned later.
2020/01/24: If a creature with a coin counter on it is put into a graveyard or exile but leaves that zone before Athreos's last ability resolves, that card stays in its new zone, even if that zone is also a graveyard or exile. You don't return it to the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If Athreos and a creature with a coin counter on it are both put into graveyards and/or exiled at the same time, the other creature will be returned to the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If Athreos somehow gets a coin counter on itself, its last ability will return it when it dies or is exiled.
2020/01/24: If Athreos leaves the battlefield, creatures with coin counters on them keep them. The counters won't have any meaning or effect unless another Athreos is on the battlefield later.
2020/01/24: If a creature with a coin counter on it stops being a creature, it keeps its coin counter, but Athreos's last ability won't trigger when that permanent dies or is exiled unless it's a creature again by that time.
2020/01/24: If a creature you don't own has a coin counter on it, that permanent will return to the battlefield under your control when it dies or is exiled while you control Athreos. In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any creatures you control from Athreos's ability are exiled.
2020/01/24: In a two-player game, if both players control an Athreos when a creature with a coin counter on it dies, the nonactive player (the one whose turn it isn't) will return the creature under their control. If that happens in a multiplayer game, the nonactive player closest to the right of the player whose turn it is will return the creature under their control.
2020/01/24: Colorless and generic mana symbols ({C}, {0}, {1}, {2}, {X}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2020/01/24: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2020/01/24: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2020/01/24: If you put an Aura on an opponent's permanent, you still control the Aura, and mana symbols in its mana cost count towards your devotion.
2020/01/24: Your devotion to two colors is the number of mana symbols among mana costs of permanents you control that are the first color, the second, or both. If an effect counts your devotion to two colors, a hybrid symbol that is both of those colors is counted just once.
2020/01/24: The type-changing ability that can make a God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color. It's always a creature spell while it's on the stack.
2020/01/24: As a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color will determine whether any replacement effects that affect creatures entering the battlefield apply to that God. Because replacement effects are considered before the God is on the battlefield, the mana symbols in its mana cost won't be counted when determining this.
2020/01/24: When a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2020/01/24: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and the creature type God. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2020/01/24: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2020/01/24: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat. It won't rejoin combat if it resumes being a creature later during that combat.
2020/01/24: Counters put on a God remain on it while it's not a creature, even if they have no effect.
2020/01/24: If an effect causes a God to lose all abilities, its ability that causes it to stop being a creature still applies if appropriate.</Rulings>
